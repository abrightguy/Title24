[F] EXPLOSION. An effect produced by the sudden violent expansion of gases, which may be accompanied by a shock wave or disruption, or both, of enclosing materials or structures. An explosion could result from any of the following:
1.
Chemical changes such as rapid oxidation, deflagration or detonation, decomposition of molecules and runaway polymerization (usually detonations).

2.
Physical changes such as pressure tank ruptures.

3.
Atomic changes (nuclear fission or fusion).


[F] EXPLOSIVE. A chemical compound, mixture or device, the primary or common purpose of which is to function by explosion.

Materials that react in this manner represent a mass explosion hazard. Such an explosive will normally cause severe structural damage to adjacent objects. Explosive propagation could occur immediately to other items of ammunition and explosives stored sufficiently close to and not adequately protected from the initially exploding pile with a time interval short enough so that two or more quantities must be considered as one for quantity-distance purposes.
UN/DOTn Class 1 explosives. The former classification system used by DOTn included the terms high and low explosives as defined herein. The following terms further define explosives under the current system applied by DOTn for all explosive materials defined as hazard Class 1 materials.

433.3 Access and exit facilities.
433.3.1 Occupant load. The occupant load for a transit station shall be based on the emergency condition requiring evacuation of that station to a point of safety. The station occupant load shall be the sum of the number of persons in the calculated train load of trains entering a station plus the entraining load of persons awaiting train(s), during a specified time period. Notwithstanding, the minimum occupant load shall not be less than the maximum capacity load of a train which would occupy the entire length of the station platform on a single track. Exiting shall be provided for occupant loads recalculated upon increase in service and/ or every five years.

The following limitations to the calculated train load shall be applied:
1.
No more than one train will unload at any one track to a platform during an emergency.

2.
The load on any single train is limited to the maximum train capacity.


433.3.1.2 Entraining load (on platform awaiting train). The entraining load is equal to the number of passengers that would accumulate on the platform in the time period equivalent to two headways or 12 minutes during the peak 15-minute period, whichever time period is greater.
This entraining load is constrained as stated as follows:
1.
Special consideration shall be given to stations servicing areas where events occur that establish occupant loads not included in normal passenger loads. These would include such areas as civic centers, sports complexes and convention centers.

2.
At multiplatform stations, each platform shall be considered separately. Arrival of trains from all normal traffic directions, plus their entraining loads, shall be considered.

3.
At concourses, mezzanines or multilevel stations, simultaneous platform loads shall be considered for all exit lanes passing through that area.

433.3.2.2.1 Exit capacities shall be calculated on the basis of 22-inch-wide (559 mm) exit lanes at the clear and narrowest point except that individual handrails may project into the required width as permitted by Chapter 10. Fractional lanes shall not be counted in measuring exit capacities except that 12 inches (305 mm) added to one or more lanes shall be counted as one-half a lane. Escalators 32 inches (813 mm) in width may be considered as 11/2 lanes.
433.3.2.2.2 There shall be sufficient means of exit to evacuate the station occupant load from the station platforms in four minutes or less.
433.3.2.2.3 The station shall also be designed to permit evacuation from the most remote point on the platform to a point of safety in six minutes or less.
433.3.2.2.4 In at-grade or elevated structures so designed that the station platform is open to the elements and, when the concourse is below or protected from the platform by distance or materials as determined by an appropriate engineering analysis, that concourse may be defined as a point of safety, with Fire Code Official concurrence.
433.3.2.2.5 To calculate evacuation time, the walking travel time should be tabulated using the longest exit route and travel speeds. To this time should be added the following factors:
1.
The waiting time at the vertical elements at platform level minus the longest walking travel time at platform level.

2.
The waiting time at the fare collection barriers minus the waiting time at the platform vertical circulation elements.

3.
The waiting time at the vertical or horizontal circulation elements from mezzanine to grade minus the waiting time at the platform vertical circulation elements or fare collection barrier, whichever is greater.

4.
The waiting time, if	 any, at any additional constriction minus the greatest previous waiting time. (Repeat for all additional constrictions.)


Note: The total of any of the factors in Items 1 through 4 above cannot be less than zero.

SECTION 703
FIRE-RESISTANCE RATINGS AND FIRE TESTS

703.1 Scope. Materials prescribed herein for fire resistance shall conform to the requirements of this chapter.
703.2 Fire-resistance ratings. The fire-resistance rating of building elements, components or assemblies shall be determined in accordance with the test procedures set forth in ASTM E 119 or UL 263 or in accordance with Section 703.3. Where materials, systems or devices that have not been tested as part of a fire-resistance-rated assembly are incorporated into the building element, component or assembly, sufficient data shall be made available to the building official to show that the required fire-resistance rating is not reduced. Materials and methods of construction used to protect joints and penetrations in fire-resistance-rated building elements, components or assemblies shall not reduce the required frre-resistance rating.
Exception: In determining the frre-resistance rating of exterior bearing walls, compliance with the ASTM E 119 or UL 263 criteria for unexposed surface temperature rise and ignition of cotton waste due to passage of flame or gases is required only for a period of time corresponding to the required frre-resistance rating of an exterior nonbearing wall with the same fire separation distance, and in a building of the same group. When the fire-resistance rating determined in accordance with this exception exceeds the fire-resistance rating determined in accordance with


2013 CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE FIRE AND SMOKE PROTECTION FEATURES







ASTM E 119 or UL263, the fire exposure time period, water pressure and application duration criteria for the hose stream test of ASTM E 119 or UL 263 shall be based upon the fire-resistance rating determined in accordance with this exception.
703.2.1 Nonsymmetrical wall construction. Interior walls and partitions of nonsymmetrical construction shall be tested with both faces exposed to the furnace, and the assigned fire-resistance rating shall be the shortest duration obtained from the two tests conducted in compliance with ASTM E 119 or UL 263. When evidence is furnished to show that the wall was tested with the least fire-resistant side exposed to the furnace, subject to acceptance of the building official, the wall need not be subjected to tests from the opposite side (see Section 705.5 for exterior walls).
703.2.2 Combustible components. Combustible aggregates are permitted in gypsum and Portland cement concrete mixtures for fire-resistance-rated construction. Any component material or admixture is permitted in assemblies if the resulting tested assembly meets the fire-resistance test requirements of this code.
703.2.3 Restrained classification. Fire-resistance-rated assemblies tested under ASTM E 119 or UL 263 shall not be considered to be restrained unless evidence satisfactory to the building official is furnished by the registered design professional showing that the construction qualifies for a restrained classification in accordance with ASTM E 119 or UL 263. Restrained construction shall be identified on the plans.
703.3 Alternative methods for determining fire resistance.
The application of any of the alternative methods listed in this section shall be based on the fire exposure and acceptance criteria specified in ASTM E 119 or UL 263. The required fire resistance of a building element, component or assembly shall be permitted to be established by any of the following methods or procedures:
1.
Fire-resistance designs documented in sources.

2.
Prescriptive designs of fire-resistance-rated building elements, components or assemblies as prescribed in Section 721.

3.
Calculations in accordance with Section 722.

4.
Engineering analysis based on a comparison of building element, component or assemblies designs having fire-resistance ratings as determined by the test procedures set forth in ASTM E 119 or UL 263.

5.
Alternative protection methods as allowed by Section


104.11.
703.4 Automatic sprinklers. Under the prescriptive fireresistance requirements of the California Building Code, the fire-resistance rating of a building element, component or assembly shall be established without the use of automatic sprinklers or any other fire suppression system being incorporated as part of the assembly tested in accordance with the fire exposure, procedures, and acceptance criteria specified in ASTM E 119 or UL 263. However, this section shall not prohibit or limit the duties and powers of the building official allowed by Sections 104. 10 and 104.11.
703.5 Noncombustibility tests. The tests indicated in Sections 703.5.1 and 703.5.2 shall serve as criteria for acceptance of building materials as set forth in Sections 602.2,
602.3 and 602.4 in Type I, II, illand IV construction. The term "noncombustible" does not apply to the flame spread characteristics of interior finish or trim materials. A material shall not be classified as a noncombustible building construction material if it is subject to an increase in combustibility or flame spread beyond the limitations herein established through the effects of age, moisture or other atmospheric conditions.
703.5.1 Elementary materials. Materials required to be noncombustible shall be tested in accordance with ASTM E 136.
703.5.2 Composite materials. Materials having a structural base of noncombustible material as determined in accordance with Section 703.5.1 with a surfacing not more than 0.125 inch (3.18 mm) thick that has a flame spread index not greater than SOwhen tested in accordance with ASTM E 84 or UL 723 shall be acceptable as noncombustible materials.


703.6 Fire-resistance-rated glazing. Fire-resistance-rated glazing, when tested in accordance with ASTM E 119 or UL 263 and complying with the requirements of Section 707, shall be permitted. Fire-resistance-rated glazing shall bear a label marked in accordance with Table 716.3 issued by an agency and shall be permanently identified on the glazing.
703.7 Marking and identification. Fire walls, fire barriers, fire partitions, smoke barriers and smoke partitions or any other wall required to have protected openings or penetrations shall be effectively and permanently identified with signs or stenciling. Such identification shall:
1.
Be located in accessible concealed floor, floor-ceiling or attic spaces;

2.
Be located within 15 feet ( 4572 mm) of the end of each wall and at intervals not exceeding 30 feet (9144 mm) measured horizontally along the wall or partition; and

3.

722.2.1.4.1 Nontire-exposed side. Where the finish of gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to the side of the wall not exposed to fire, the contribution of the finish to the total fire-resistance rating shall be determined as follows: The thickness of the finish shall first be corrected by multiplying the actual thickness of the finish by the applicable factor determined from Table 722.2.1.4(1) based on the type of aggregate in the concrete. The corrected thickness of finish shall then be added to the actual or equivalent thickness of concrete and fire-resistance rating of the concrete and finish determined from Table
722.2.1.1, Figure 722.2.1.2 or Table 722.2.1.2(1).
FIRE AND SMOKE PROTECTION FEATURES
722.2.1.4.2 Fire-exposed side. Where gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to the fire-exposed side of the wall, the contribution of the finish to the total fire-resistance rating shall be determined as follows: The time assigned to the finish as established by Table 722.2.1.4(2) shall be added to the frre-resistance rating determined from Table 722.2. 1.1 or Figure 722.2.1.2, or Table 722.2.1.2(1) for the concrete alone, or to the rating determined in Section
722.2.1.4.1 for the concrete and finish on the nonfire-exposed side.
722.2.1.4.3 Nonsymmetrical assemblies. For a wall having no finish on one side or different types or thicknesses of finish on each side, the calculation procedures of Sections 722.2.1.4.1 and 722.2.1.4.2 shall be performed twice, assuming either side of the wall to be the fire-exposed side. The fire-resistance rating of the wall shall not exceed the lower of the two values.
Exception: For an exterior wall with a frre separation distance greater than 5 feet (1524 mm) the fire shall be assumed to occur on the interior side only.
722.2.1.4.4 Minimum concrete tire-resistance rating. Where fmishes applied to one or both sides of a concrete wall contribute to the frre-resistance rating, the concrete alone shall provide not less than onehalf of the total required fire-resistance rating. Additionally, the contribution to the fire resistance of the finish on the nonfire-exposed side of a load-bearing wall shall not exceed one-half the contribution of the concrete alone.
722.2.1.4.5 Concrete f'mishes. Finishes on concrete walls that are assumed to contribute to the total fireresistance rating of the wall shall comply with the installation requirements of Section 722.3.2.5.

SECTION 1105A GARAGES, CARPORTS AND PARKING FACILITIES
11 05A.1 General Garages, carports and other parking facil
ities, which are accessory to covered multifamily dwelling
units, shall be accessible as required in Section 1109A.
SECTION 1106A SITE AND BUILDING CHARACTERISTICS
1106A.1 General Covered multifamily dwellings with elevators shall be designed and constructed to provide at least one accessible entrance on an accessible route, regardless of terrain or unusual characteristics of the site. Covered multifamily dwellings without elevators shall be designed and constructed to provide at least one accessible entrance on an accessible route unless terrain or unusual characteristics of the site prevent an accessible route based on the conditions listed below:

1.
Accessible entrance. Regardless of site considerations described in Section 1150A, an accessible entrance on an accessible route is required when there is an elevator connecting the parking area with the dwelling units on a ground floor. (In this case, those dwelling units on the ground floor served by an elevator, and at least one of each type of public-and common-use areas, would be subject to these requirements.)

2.
Elevator building. When a building elevator or elevators are provided as a means of access to dwelling units


()

other than dwelling units on a ground floor (see Section 1104A.2), the building is an elevator building. All dwelling units become covered multifamily dwellings in
HOUSING ACCESSIBILITY
that building. The elevator in that building must provide accessibility to all dwelling units in the building, regardless of the slope of the natural terrain. For multistory dwelling units in buildings with one or more elevators, see Section 1102A.3.2.
Note: Where a building elevator is provided only as means of creating an accessible route to covered multifamily dwelling units on a ground floor, the building is not considered to be an elevator building, only dwelling units located on the ground floor shall be required to comply with this chapter.
3. 	Elevated walkway. When an elevated walkway is planned between a building entrance and a vehicular or pedestrian arrival point, and the planned walkway has a slope no greater than 10 percent (1 unit vertical in 10 units horizontal), the floor being served by the elevated walkway becomes a ground floor and accessibility to all dwellings on that ground floor is required.
Note: Since the planned walkway meets the 10 percent slope criterion, it is required to provide an accessible route to the entrance, and the slope of the walkway must be reduced to 1 unit vertical in 12 units horizontal (8.33 percent slope) maximum.
1106A.2 Site impracticality. For tests to determine site
impracticality due to terrain considerations in nonelevator
buildings, see Section 1150A.

SECTION 1150A
SITE IMPRACTICALITY TESTS

IISOA.l GeneraL Covered multifamily dwellings in buildings without an elevator, located on sites with difficult terrain conditions or unusual characteristics, may employ the site impracticality tests in this division for determining the accessibility and adaptability provisions required by this chapter.
Except as provided for in Section 1 102A.3.1, the provisions of this section do not apply to multistory dwelling units in nonelevator buildings.
SINGLE BUILDING WITH
ONE COMMON ENTRANCE

The following may only be used for determining required access to covered multifamily dwelling units, in a single building with one common (lobby) entrance, located on a site with difficult terrain conditions or unusual characteristics:
All ground floor units in nonelevator buildings shall be adaptable and on an accessible route unless an accessible route to the common (lobby) entrance is not required as determined by Test No. 1, Individual Building Test, or Test No. 3, Unusual Characteristics Test, as described in this section.
Sites where either Test No. 1 or Test No. 3 is used and it is determined that an accessible route to the common (lobby) entrance is not required, at least 20 percent of the ground floor dwelling units shall comply with Division IV, and all remaining ground floor dwelling units shall comply with the features listed in Section 1150A.2 unless exempted by Test No. 3, Unusual Characteristics Test.
Test No. 1-lndividual Building Test may only be used if the site has terrain over 15 percent slope.
Test No. 3 -Unusual Characteristics Test may be used if applicable.
Provisions to Test Nos. 1 and 2. Where a building elevator is provided only as means of creating an accessible route to covered multifamily dwelling units on a ground floor, the building is not considered to be an elevator building for purposes of this code; hence, only the ground floor dwelling units would be covered.
TEST NO. 1-INDIVIDUAL BUILDING TEST
It is not required by this code to provide an accessible route when the terrain of the site is such that both of the following apply:
1.
The slopes of the undisturbed site measured between the planned entrance and all vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance exceed 15 percent; and

2.
The slopes of the planned finished grade measured between the entrance and all vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet ( 15 240 mm) of the planned entrance also exceed 15 percent.


If there are no vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet ( 15 240 mm) of the planned entrance, the slope for the purposes of Test No. 1 will be measured to the closest vehicular or pedestrian arrival point.
For purposes of these requirements, vehicular or pedestrian arrival points include public or resident parking areas, public transportation stops, passenger loading zones and public streets or sidewalks. To determine site impracticality, the slope would be measured at ground level from the point of the planned entrance on a straight line to ( 1) each vehicular or pedestrian arrival point that is within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance, or
(2) if there are no vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within the specified area, the vehicular or pedestrian arrival point closest to the planned entrance. In the case of sidewalks, the closest point to the entrance will be where a public sidewalk entering the site intersects with the walk to the entrance. In the case of resident parking areas, the closest point to the planned entrance will be measured from the entry point to the parking area that is located closest to the planned entrance.
TEST NO. 2-51TE ANALYSIS TEST
For a site having multiple buildings, or a site with a single building with multiple entrances, it is not required to provide an accessible route to all ground floor units under the following conditions:
1.
Calculate the percentage of the total buildable area of the undisturbed site with a natural grade less than 10-percent slope. The analysis of the existing slope (before grading) shall be done on a topographic survey with 2-foot (610 mm) contour intervals with slope determination made between each successive interval. The accuracy of the slope analysis shall be certified by a licensed engineer, landscape architect, architect or surveyor.

2.
Determine the requirement of providing an accessible route to planned multifamily dwellings based on the topography of the existing natural terrain. The minimum percentage of ground floor units required







BLUE

HOUSING ACCESSIBILITY

0 on an accessible route shall equal the percentage of the total buildable area (not restricted-use areas) of
the undisturbed site with an existing natural grade of less than 10-percent slope. In no case shall less than 20 percent of the ground floor dwelling units be on an accessible route and comply with the provisions of Division N.
3.
In addition to the percentage established in paragraph (2 ), all additional ground floor units in a building, or ground floor units served by a particular entrance, that fall within an 8.33-percent slope between their planned entrances and an arrival point shall be on an accessible route and comply with the provisions of Division N.

4.
