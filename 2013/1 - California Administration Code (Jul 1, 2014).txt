PREFACE 

This document is the 1st of 12 parts of the official triennial compilation and publication of the adoptions, amendments and repeal of administrative regulations to California Code ofRegulations, Title 24, also referred to as the California Building Standards Code. This part is known as the California Administrative Code, also known as the California Building Standards Administrative Code. 
The California Building Standards Code is published in its entirety every three years by order ofthe California legislature, with supplements published in intervening years. The California legislature delegated authority to various state agencies, boards, commissions and departments to create building regulations to implement the State's statutes. These building reg­ulations, or standards, have the same force of law, and take effect 180 days after their publication unless otherwise stipu­lated. The California Building Standards Code applies to occupancies in the State of California as annotated. 
A city, county, or city and county may establish more restrictive building standards reasonably necessary because of local climatic, geological or topographical conditions. Findings ofthe local condition(s) and the adopted local building standard( s) must be filed with the California Building Standards Commission to become effective and may not be effec­tive sooner than the effective date of this edition of the California Building Standards Code. Local building standards that were adopted and applicable to previous editions of the California Building Standards Code do not apply to this edition without appropriate adoption and the required filing. 
Should you find publication (e.g., typographical) errors or inconsistencies in this code or wish to offer comments toward improving its format, please address your comments to:

California Matrix Adoption Tables 
Format of the California Matrix Adoption Tables 
The matrix adoption tables, examples of which follow, are non-regulatory aids intended to show the user which state agencies have adopted and/or amended given sections of the model code. An agency's statutory authority for certain occupancies or building applications determines which chapter or section may be adopted, repealed, amended or added. See Chapter 1, Division I, Sections 
1.2 through 1.14 for agency authority, building applications and enforcement responsibilities. 
The side headings identify the scope of state agencies' adoption as follows: 

Adopt the entire IBC chapter without state amendments. 
If there is an "X" under a particular state agency's acronym on this row; this means that particular state agency has adopted the entire model code chapter without any state amendments.

1-315. Criteria for petition. A petition for the adoption, amendment or repeal of a state building standard must meet the following criteria: 
(a) 
The subject issue must have statewide significance and must have implications for a whole category of projects or a broad range of project types, and: 

(b) 
The rationale for the petition must take the form of at least one of the following criteria: 


1. 	
A current building standard conflicts with pertinent statute(s). To substantiate this criterion, the petitioner must cite the subject building standard and the conflict­ing statute(s), and provide a clear written description of why the two are inconsistent. 

2. 	
Compliance with a current building standard is rou­tinely impossible or onerous. To substantiate this crite­rion, the petitioner must cite the current building standard, present written or photographic evidence of the difficulty in complying with it, and clearly show that the problem is common or potentially common to many different projects or project types in many different cir­cumstances. This criterion shall not be used to justify a petition for the repeal or amendment of a current build­ing standard that poses difficulty to a single project. 

3. 	
A current building standard is inefficient or ineffective. To substantiate this criterion, the petitioner must cite the subject building standard, provide clear and concise written or photographic evidence of its ineffectiveness or inefficiency, describe a proposed alternative, and provide clear and convincing written or photographic evidence that it is more efficient or effective. 

4. 
A current building standard is obsolete. To substantiate this criterion, the petitioner must show at least one of the following facts: 


A. A material or product specified in the building standard is not available, or 
B. There is no statute authorizing the subject building standard, or 
C. Significant developments in procedures, materials or other issues subject to the building standard have created a need for amendment or deletion of the building standard; that current state statutes permit amendment or deletion of the building standards; and that the building standard has the effect of pro­hibiting the use of a material or procedure that has demonstrated satisfactory performance and meets the intended purpose of building standards. 
5. 	There is a need for a new building standard. To substan­tiate this criterion, the petitioner must provide a clear written description of the proposed building standard, explain why it is necessary, and cite the statute(s) that require or authorize the new building standard.

ARTICLE 1 
ESSENTIAL SERVICES BUILDINGS 


4-201. Purpose. Essential services buildings constructed pur­suant to these rules and regulations shall be designed and con­structed to resist gravity forces, to minimize fire hazards and to resist, insofar as practical, the forces generated by winds and major earthquakes of the intensity and severity of the strongest anticipated at the building site without catastrophic collapse, but may experience some repairable architectural or structural damage. An essential services building as designed and con­structed shall be capable of providing essential services to the public after a disaster. In addition, the equipment and other accessories which are necessary for the continued functioning of the essential services operation shall be anchored and braced to resist earthquake forces. 
Authority: Health and Safety Code Section 16022. 
Reference: Health and Safety Code Section 16001. 
4-202. Scope. These regulations apply to the administrative procedures concerning the construction, reconstruction, alter­ation of or addition to any essential services building under the jurisdiction of a city, city and county, county (including special fire districts) or the State of California. 
When the enforcement agency is the Division of the State Architect (DSA) all parts of the California Building Standards Code, as contained in Title 24 of the California Code ofRegula­tions and adopted by that agency designate the building regula­tions which shall apply to an essential services building. The term "essential services building" shall include all buildings, structures, appurtenances and related systems or facilities as defined in Section 4-207. 
These rules and regulations establish reasonable standards and minimum requirements for the design and construction of an essential services building. An essential services building shall also be designed and constructed to conform to the regula­tions adopted by the California State Fire Marshal in Title 24, CCR, for the particular occupancy concerned. 
When the enforcement agency is a local agency, the locally adopted editions of the model codes and the administrative reg­ulations contained in Part 1 (Sections 4-201 through 4-222 and 4-243 through 4-249) Title 24, California Code of Regulations (CCR) designate the building regulations which shall apply to an essential services building. The term "essential services building" shall include all buildings, structures, appurtenances and related systems or facilities as defined in Section 4-207. 
Ifthe building standards and regulations adopted by the city, city and county or county agency responsible for building safety are more restrictive than those adopted in the applicable sections of Title 24, CCR, then the local building standards and regulations shall govern within its jurisdiction. 
Authority: Health and Safety Code Section 16022. 
Reference: Health and Safety Code Section 16001. 
4-203. Interpretation. No regulation shall be construed to deprive the enforcing agency of its right to exercise the powers conferred upon it by law or limit the enforcing agency in such enforcement as is necessary to secure the safety of construction as required in the Essential Services Seismic Safety Act (see "Act," Section 4-207. 
Authority: Health and Safety Code Section 16022.

4-211. Observation and inspection of construction. 
(a) 
Observation by architect or registered engineer. The Act provides that the observation of the work of construction, reconstruction, alteration or addition shall be under the general responsible charge of an architect, structural engineer, civil engi­neer or, under certain conditions, a registered mechanical or electrical engineer for work involving only those respective branches of engineering. A geotechnical engineer shall provide the observation for placement of fills and shall submit a verified report attesting to the compliance of the engineered fill. 

(b) 
Inspection by project inspector. The owner must pro­vide for and require competent, adequate and continuous inspection of all construction work by a project inspector approved for each individual project by the enforcement agency. The project inspector so approved shall cooperate with the architect or registered engineer in general responsible charge of the observation of the work of construction to ensure compliance with the approved drawings and specifications. The project inspector shall request interpretations and clarifi­cations of the approved contract drawings and specifications 


when necessary from the responsible architect or registered engineer. 
For every project there shall be a project inspector who shall have personal knowledge as defined in Section 16021 of the Health and Safety Code of all work done on the project or its parts. On large projects adequate inspection may require the employment of one or more approved assistant inspectors. The employment of special inspectors or assistant inspectors shall not be construed as relieving the project inspector of his/her duties and responsibilities under Sections 4-214 and 4-219 of these regulations. The project inspector shall, under the direc­tion of the architect or engineer, be responsible for monitoring the work of the special inspectors and testing laboratories to ensure that the special inspection and testing program is satis­factorily completed. 
No work shall be carried out except under the inspection of the project inspector approved by the enforcement agency. The project inspector shall have had at least three years equivalent experience in construction work of a type similar to that for which he/she is proposed as inspector, shall have a thorough knowledge of building materials, and shall be able to read and interpret plans and specifications. 
The cost of project inspection shall be paid for by the owner (see "Project Inspector" definition in Section 4-207). 
(c) Special inspection. Special inspection by inspectors spe­cially approved by the enforcement agency may be required for masonry construction, glued laminated lumber fabrication, wood framing using timber connectors, concrete hatching, shotcrete, prestressed concrete, structural steel fabrication, high-strength steel bolt installations, welding, pile driving, elec­trical work or mechanical work. The cost ofall special inspectors required by this section shall be paid for by the owner. 
The project inspector may perform special inspections if the project inspector has been specially approved for such pur­poses and has the time available to complete the special inspec­tions in addition to project inspection work. 
The detailed inspection of all work covered by this section is the responsibility of the project inspector when special inspec­tion is not provided. The enforcement agency may require spe­cial inspection for shop fabrication procedures that preclude the complete inspection of the work after assembly. The enforcement agency may require special inspection at the site in addition to those listed above if found necessary because of the special use of material or methods of construction. 
Approved special inspectors shall submit verified reports as required by Section 4-214, for the special work covered. Special inspectors shall periodically submit reports of inspections to the enforcement agency, the architect, the registered engineer responsible for the observation ofstructural work and the project inspector. Construction work that the special inspector finds not to be in compliance with the approved plans and specifications, and which is not immediately corrected upon notifying the con­tractor, shall be reported immediately to the project inspector, the enforcement agency, the architect and the registered engineer responsible for observation of the structural work.

(a) General. After DSA has completed its review of the doc­uments submitted with the application, the checked prints of the plans and specifications with the requests for corrections and/or additional information noted thereon shall be returned to the responsible architect or registered engineer. When plans and/or specifications require extensive corrections, a corrected set of prints of the plans and specifications shall be submitted for review if requested by DSA. 
When the requested corrections have been made and/or the additional information as requested has been provided by the responsible architect or registered engineer, an employee rep­resentative of the architect or registered engineer shall return the check set ofplans and specifications along with the original plan tracings, the corrected specification pages and specifica­tion master cover sheet to DSA for backchecking. The backcheck is a comparison ofthe corrected plans and specifica­tions with the check set of plans and specifications and shall be accomplished either by a conference at the DSA office between the architect or registered engineer or his/her employee repre­sentative and the checking engineer or by mail in the case of minor corrections to which all parties have agreed. 
Changes in plans and specifications, other than changes nec­essary for correction, made after submission for approval shall be brought to the attention of DSA in writing or by submission ofrevised plans identifying those changes clearly at the time of back-checking. Failure to give such notice may result in the voidance of any subsequent approval given to the plans and specifications. 
All requested corrections shall be made, additional requested information furnished or original designs justified and a list of materials to be tested and special inspections to be made shall be supplied to DSA at the time ofbackcheck. When DSA deems that the corrected plans and specifications comply with these regulations and all parts of Title 24, CCR, that per­tain to essential services building construction, DSA shall place its stamp of identification on the reproducible sheets of drawings and master cover sheet of the specifications. This stamp is affixed for purposes of identification only and shall not be construed as authorization to let the construction con­tracts. 
One set of prints of the stnmped plans and specifications shall be submitted to DSA. The submittal of the stamped prints of the plans and specifications is required before DSA will issue the written notice of approval of the application. 
(b) Approval of the application. DSA shall issue to the owner of the essential services building a letter approving the application for the project upon receipt of the stamped copies of the approved plans and specifications. This letter shall con­stitute the approval of drawings and specifications as required by Section 16016 of the Health and Safety Code. No contract for construction shall be let or approved by the owner of the essential services building and no monies shall be spent for construction work on an essential services building project until this approval in writing has been had and obtained. 
DSA will retain one set of the stamped plans and specifica­tions and other pertinent project information in its files as a per­manent record of the compliance of the approved project documents. 
(c) Voidance of the application. Any change, erasure, alter­ation or modification of any plans or specifications bearing the identification stamp of DSA may result in voidance of the approval of the application. However, the "written approval of plans" may be extended by DSA to include revised plans and specifications after documents are submitted for review and approved. (See Section 4-233 for revised plans and Section 4-215 for addenda and change orders.) 
The procedures leading to written approval of plans shall be carried to conclusion without suspension or unnecessary delay. The application shall be void where either (1) prints from cor­rected plans or corrected original plans are not filed for backcheck and the backcheck is not completed within six months after the date ofreturn ofthe checked plans to the archi­tect or registered engineer, or (2) prints of the stamped plans and one set of the stamped specifications are not submitted to DSA files within two months after the date shown on the stamp of identification.

4-229. Deferred approvals. Where a portion of the construc­tion cannot be adequately detailed on the approved plans because of variations in product design and manufacture, the approval of plans for such portion, when specifically accepted by the enforcement agency, may be deferred until the material suppliers are selected provided the following conditions are met: 
(a) 	
The project plans clearly indicate that a deferred approval by the enforcement agency prior to the fabri­cation and installation is required for the indicated por­tions of the work. 

(b) 	
The project plans and specifications adequately describe the performance and loading criteria for such work. 

(c) 	
An architect or registered engineer stamps and signs the plans and specifications for the deferred approval items. The architect or engineer in general responsible charge of the design of the project shall submit the plans and specifications for the deferred approval item to the enforcement agency, with notation indicating that the deferred approval documents have been found to be in general conformance with the design of the building. 


(d) 	Deferred approval shall not apply to the requirements ofSection 4-210 (b), (c) and (d) with regard to the verti­cal and lateral load resisting systems and elements of the building. The plans, details, specifications and computations for the structural portions of the building shall provide sufficient information to permit a com­plete review when the project is submitted.

(a) 
General. No additional fee is charged upon submission of revisions to the approved plans and specifications, provided that the entire matter is actually one transaction having to do with the same essential services building and the revisions do not require substantial review for safety of design. If the origi­nal plans are abandoned and the plans and specifications sub­mitted in lieu thereof are in fact for a new project rather than an identical building or where a modified set of plans is for an essentially different structural concept, it is necessary that a new application be filed and fee paid. This is regardless of the fact that the building may have the same name, be of the same general size and be situated at the same location as the essential services building for which the original application was sub­mitted. 

(b) 
Addenda. Changes or alterations of the approved plans or specifications prior to letting a construction contract for the work involved shall be made by means of addenda. Addenda shall be stamped and signed by the architect or registered engi­neer in general responsible charge of preparation of the plans and specifications, and by the architect or registered engineer delegated responsibility for the portion affected by the addenda. Addenda shall be submitted to DSA for review and approval and as such become part ofthe approved contract doc­uments. 

(c) 
Change orders. Changes or alterations of the approved plans or specifications after a contract for the work has been let shall be made by means of change orders. Change orders shall state the reason for the change, indicate the change in contract cost, if any, and shall be accompanied by supplementary draw­ings and calculations where necessary. All change orders shall be stamped and signed by the architect ur registered engineer in general responsible charge of the work of construction of the project, and by the architect or registered engineer delegated responsibility for observation of the portion of the work ofcon­


struction affected by the change order, and shall bear the signa­ture of the authorized representative of the owner. Change orders shall be submitted to DSA for review and approval and as such become part of the approved contract documents. 
To avoid unnecessary delays in the completion of the work, the enforcement agency, at its discretion, may extend tentative verbal approval ofproposed change order items upon receipt of sufficient information from the architect or registered engineer in general responsible charge to permit the enforcement agency to make a reasonable judgment on those items. At the earliest possible date subsequent to the tentative approval, the architect or registered engineer in general responsible charge shall sub­mit to the enforcement agency for approval a formal completed change order covering those items given tentative verbal approval.

4-309. Reconstruction or alteration projects in excess of $25,000 in cost. 
(a) General. Plans and specifications for any reconstruction or alteration project exceeding $25,000 in cost shall be submit­ted to DSA for approval in accordance with Section 4-315, except as provided within this section. The cost of work classi­fied as maintenance as defined in Section 4-314 shaH not be considered for purposes of this section. When the estimated cost of a reconstruction or alteration project exceeds $25,000 but does not exceed $100,000, and a licensed structural engi­neer determines that the project does not include any work of a structural nature, approval of the project plans and specifica­tions by DSA is not required, provided the following three items are completed: 
1. 	
The structural engineer shall submit a written statement to DSA, indicating that the project does not contain any work of a structural nature. 

2. 	
The design professional in general responsible charge of the project shall certify, in writing, that the plans and specifications for the project meet any applicable fire and life-safety standards, and do not specify any work of construction that is regulated by the accessibility stan­dards of Title 24. This certification shall be submitted to DSA, and shall bear the stamp and signature of the design professional. 

3. 	
Within 10 days of the completion of the project, a DSA certified project inspector shall sign and submit to DSA a verified report on a form prescribed by DSA, indicating that the project was completed in conformance with the plans and specifications. 


The dollar amount cited in this section shall be increased on an annual basis, according to an inflationary index governing 
II construction costs that is selected and recognized by DSA. This annually adjusted dollar amount shall be published by DSA and made available to school boards and the public. 
School construction projects shall not be subdivided for the purpose of evading the cost limitations of this section. 
All new construction work, which is part of a reconstruction or alteration project shall comply with currently effective regu­lations. 
Exception: Fire damage repair may be accomplished utiliz­ing the approved plans and specifications for the original construction work. All regulations and standards in effect at the time of approval shall be complied with except that the testing and inspection requirements of current regulations shall apply to the reconstruction work. Minor modifications to the original approved plans may be made, subject to the approval of DSA, provided that they do not reduce the struc­tural capacity of the building. 
Structural modifications to the existing structural system not exceeding the limits defined in Section 4-309 (c) 2 are permit­ted to be evaluated and designed in compliance with the wind and seismic provisions contained in Part 2, Title 24 that are applicable to new buildings. Alternatively, the seismic provi­sions for voluntary lateral-force resisting system modifications contained in Section 3417.11, Part 2, Title 24, are permitted to be used, and wind forces are permitted to be determined in 
II 
accordance with the Envelope and Simplified Procedure in Chapters 28 and 30 of ASCE 7. 
(b) Existing noncomplying, nonstructural elements. Existing noncomplying, nonstructural elements discovered during the design or construction of a reconstruction, alteration or addition to an existing complying school building and directly affected by the work of construction shall be corrected to comply with the bracing and anchorage requirements ofcur­rently effective regulations. 
(c) Required structural rehabilitation. Existing school buildings for which a reconstruction, alteration or addition pro­ject is proposed shall be evaluated, and retrofitted as required to comply with currently effective regulations applicable to the rehabilitation of structural systems per Section 4-306, includ-II ing wind and seismic force requirements, when any of the fol­lowing conditions occur: 
1. 	When the cost of the reconstruction, alteration, or addi­tion project exceeds $25,000 and 50 percent of the replacement value of the existing building. Maintenance work and air-conditioning equipment and insulation materials costs need not be included in the percentage of replacement value calculation. For the purposes of this 
section, the cost of the reconstruction, alteration or addi­tion project shall not include the cost of voluntary lateral force-resisting system modifications in accordance with Section 4-309(d). If these voluntary lateral force-resist­ing system modification costs are to be excluded and the structure is located in a fault hazard zone, a geologic haz­ard report shall be prepared demonstrating that the struc­ture is not located within 50 feet of the trace of an active 
fault as defined in Section 4-317(e), otherwise these costs shall be included. 
2. 	When the cost of the reconstruction, alterations or addi­tion project exceeds $25,000 but does not exceed 50 per­cent ofthe replacement value of the existing building and the proposed modifications, either: 
A. Increase the effective seismic weight or wind force in any story by more than 10 percent, or; 
B. Decrease the design capacity of any existing struc­tural component by more than 5 percent, unless the component has the capacity to resist the retrofit design forces. 
3. When a change of occupancy results in a structure being II reclassified to a higher risk category. 
Ifthe base shear capacity has been increased since the origi­nal construction, the percent change in base shear is permitted to be calculated relative to the increased capacity. 
(d) 
Voluntary lateral force-resisting system modifica­tions. Alterations to existing structural components or addi­tions of new structural components that do not exceed the limitations of Section 4-309(c)2 and are initiated for the pur­pose of increasing the strength or stiffness of the lateral force­resisting system of an existing structure are permitted to be evaluated and designed in accordance with Section 3417.11 of Part 2, Title 24, for voluntary lateral force-resisting system modifications. 

(e) 
When structural damage due to an earthquake is repaired, all portions of the structure associated to this damage shall be retrofitted to comply with currently effective regulations.

ARTICLE 3 APPROVAL OF DRAWINGS AND SPECIFICATIONS 
4-315. Application for approval of drawings and specifica­tions. 
(a) General. Before awarding a contract or commencing with construction of a school building project, the school board shall submit an application to the Division of the State Architect and obtain written approval of the plans and specifications for any of the following: 
1. 	
The construction of any new school building, or rehabili­tation of or addition to any existing school building. School building is defined in Section 4-314. 

2. 	
The reconstruction or alteration of an existing school building ifthe estimated cost exceeds $25,000. (See Sec­tion 4-308 and 4-309.) 

3. 	
The lease or purchase of any relocatable building except where occupied as a temporary-use building. 


Exception: The school board may award a contract and commence construction of a "relocatable build­ing" of a type previously approved by DSA under emergency conditions and with concurrence by DSA. These structures shall not be placed on a school site until the plans and specifications for the site work have been approved by DSA. 

4. 	
The extension of a lease for a "temporary-use" building for more than three years from the date of first occu­pancy. 

5. 	
The rehabilitation of a nonschool building to use as a "school building." (See Sections 4-306 and 4-307.) 


It is not necessary to secure approval for maintenance work on school buildings, in accordance with Sections 4-308 and 4-309. See Section 4-314 for the definition of "maintenance." 
(b) Filing. A separate application shall be submitted to DSA for each school building or group of school buildings on each school site. In the event that a number of school buildings, on various and separate sites, are to be constructed from the same plans and specifications, only one application shall be required, provided that all buildings are constructed at the same time and within the same school district. The application shall 
II be submitted on a form prescribed by DSA. The application shall contain a project name for the school building or group of buildings, the name of the architect or registered engineer in general responsible charge of the work, the names of the arc hi­tects or registered engineers who have been delegated respon­sibility for portions of the work (see Section 4-316), the estimated cost of the project and all such other information as is requested thereon. 
(c) Delayed filing. In case the plans and specifications for the reconstruction or alteration of any school building have not been submitted to DSA under the assumption that the cost will not exceed $25,000, the school board shall, if the bids which are received indicate that the cost will be in excess of $25,000, delay letting a contract until such time as the plans and specifi­cations have been submitted and the approval by DSA obtained. The contract or contracts, when made, shall be based on the duly approved plans and specifications.

Filed with the Secretary of State on December 15, 1992; effective July 1, 1993. Approved by the California Building Standards Commission on December 9, 1992. 
4-316. Designation of responsibilities. 
(a) General responsible charge. For every project there shall be an architect or structural engineer in general responsi­ble charge of the preparation of the plans, specifications and observation of the work of construction, except that where plans, specifications or work of construction for alterations or repairs do not involve architectural or structural changes said plans, specifications and observation of the work of construc­tion may be under the responsible charge of a professional engineer qualified to perform services and registered in that branch of engineering applicable to the work. 
A project may be divided into parts, provided that each part is clearly defined by a building or similar distinct unit. The part, so defined, shall include all portions and utility systems or facilities necessary to the complete functioning of that part. Separate assignments of general responsible charge may be made for the parts. 
(b) Delegation of responsibility. The architect or structural engineer in general responsible charge may delegate responsi­bility for any portion of the work to, or may employ or retain, other architects or registered engineers. No delegation to, or employment or retention of others shall be construed as reliev­ing the architect or structural engineer in general responsible charge of his or her rights, duties and responsibilities under Sections 17302 and 81138 of the Education Code and Sections 4-336, 4-341 and 4-344 of these regulations. Whenever an engineer or architect has accepted delegation for the design of portions of the plans and specifications, that same engineer or architect shall observe the construction of the same portions of the design. 
Subject to the provisions of the immediately precedent sen­tence, the architect or structural engineer in general responsible charge shall employ or retain, under his or her supervision, pro­fessional engineers registered in the applicable branches of engineering to design and observe the construction, including the making of verified reports (see Section 4-336), of the mechanical and electrical portions ofthe work, but this require­ment for observation of construction may be waived by DSA II when special mechanical and electrical inspection is provided. 
(c) Assumption of responsibility. The architect or regis­tered engineer who submits for approval plans and specifica­tions for any project or portion of a project which have been prepared by others shall assume responsibility for the safety of design of the completed construction and for the interpretation of and any necessary amplification of the plans and specifica­tions of the project. The responsible architect or engineer shall stamp and sign all original tracings or all copies of plans sub­mitted for approval to indicate his or her assumption of respon­sibility or may in lieu thereof stamp and sign and submit plans prepared under his or her own charge. [See Section 4-317 (h) for other signatures.j 
When an architect or registered engineer accepts the respon­sibility for completion of a project or portion of a project started by another, that architect or registered engineer thereby assumes responsibility as follows: 
1. 	
Ifthe change in responsibility occurs prior to the comple­tion of the design documents, all responsibility shall be assumed. (See first paragraph of this subsection for pro­cedure.) 

2. 	
If the change in responsibility occurs after the design drawings and specifications have been completed and approved by DSA, the assuming architect or registered engineer shall be responsible for the construction of the project in accordance with the design of the previous architect or engineer. The assuming architect or regis­tered engineer shall assume responsibility for the inter­pretation of and any necessary amplification of the plans and specifications and shall stamp and sign any such documents prepared for that purpose. 


2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE 
(d) Acceptance of responsibility. The assumption of gen­

eral responsible charge or of delegated responsibility shall be reported using the form(s) prescribed by DSA. Any change in the assumption of the general responsible charge or of dele­gated responsibility shall be reported using the form(s) pre­scribed by DSA. Ifno form is available for a specific delegation or change, the delegation of responsibility shall be reported in letter form, which shall include an indication that the school board has been notified. 
(e) 
Evidence of responsibility. The stamp and signature of the architect or registered engineer on a plan, specification or other document shall be deemed evidence that full responsibil­ity is assumed by the signatory for the work shown thereon, including also those portions of the accompanying computa­tions, specifications or plans which pertain to such work, unless express notice of disclaimer of responsibility is given in writing to DSA prior to the approval of the plans and specifica­tions. 

(f) 
Alternates. The applicant, or the architect or registered engineer having general or delegated responsibility, may name one or more persons to act as alternate(s) for the design and/or observation of the work ofconstruction, provided such persons are architects or registered engineers who themselves are quali­fied under these rules and regulations to assume the responsi­bility assigned. 


II 
Alternates may be named on a form prescribed by DSA, or in 
letter form. Letters or forms shall be submitted to DSA prior to performance of work by the alternate and shall include an indi­cation that the school board has been notified.

Filed with the Secretary of State on December 15, 1992; effective July 1, 1993. Approved by the California Building Standards Commission on December 9, 1992. 

4-317. Plans, specifications, calculations and other data. 
(a) General. When an application for approval of plans and specifications is filed, it shall be accompanied by three com­plete sets of the plans and specifications, a copy of the struc­tural design calculations, the site data and a fee payment calculated on the estimated cost. The three complete sets of plans and specifications include the set required by Section 5-103 of Title 24, Part 1, California Code of Regulations. (See Section 4-320.) 
II 	Exception: DSA may require than an application for pro­jects using the collaborative process for project review per Education Code Section 17319 or 81133.1 be accompanied by the filing fees per Sections 4-320 and 5-104. The dead­line for submittal of completed plans, specifications and supporting documentation shall be determined by DSA in consultation with the applicant, and shall not exceed 18 months from the application date. Failure to comply with the established de11dline may result in voidance ofthe appli­cation. 
Plans and specifications which when submitted are deter­mined by DSA to be incomplete or incorrect, shall be returned 
SAFETY OF CONSTRUCTION OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS 

to the architect or engineer in general responsible charge with a request for compliance with these regulations before checking is started by DSA. 
(b) Plans. Plans shall designate the use or occupancy of all parts of the school buildings and shall give such other informa­tion as may be required to indicate the nature of the work pro­posed and to show compliance with the act and these regulations. The plans shall be legible and sufficiently detailed and cross-referenced to show clearly the pertinent features of the construction, and shall have sufficient dimensions to be readily interpreted. Where a project includes several school buildings, the plans for each shall be drawn independently except that details common to all need not be repeated. 
The architect or engineer in general responsible charge or the professional engineer delegated responsibility for the design of the structural system of the project shall design and detail the anchorage and bracing of nonstructural elements. The details for the bracing and anchorage of nonstructural ele­ments shall be shown on the drawings adjacent to the nonstructural elements to which they apply. 
(c) Specifications. Specifications shall completely set forth the requirements for the various types of materials that will enter into permanent construction and shall describe the meth­ods not covered in the technical regulations which are to be used to obtain the required quality of the work shown on the plans as described in the specifications. 
Due to the difficulty of anticipating every unsatisfactory condition that might be found in existing construction where addition, alteration, rehabilitation or reconstruction work is proposed, the following clause or one of similar meaning shall be included in the specifications: 
"Should any existing conditions such as deterioration or non-complying construction be discovered which is not covered by the DSA approved documents wherein the fin­ished work will not comply with Title 24, California Code of Regulations, a construction change document, or a sepa­rate set ofplans and specifications, detailing and specifying the required repair work shall be submitted to and approved by DSA before proceeding with the repair work." 
(d) Design calculations. Calculations, stress diagrams and other pertinent data shall accompany the plans and specifica­tions and shall be sufficiently complete so that capacities for individual structural members and their connections can be verified without additional calculations. All assumptions used in the calculations and their bases shall be stated. The calcula­tions shall be prefaced by a statement clearly and concisely out­lining the basis for the structural design and indicating the manner in which the proposed school building will resist verti­calloads and horizontal forces. 
The calculations shall be sufficiently complete to establish that the structure will resist the loads and forces prescribed in Part 2, Title 24, C.C.R. Assumed safe bearing pressures on soils and specified strengths ofconcrete shall be given in calcu­lations and noted on plans. Where unusual conditions occur, such additional data as are pertinent to the work shall be sub­mitted. 
(e) Site data. Site data for all school sites shall include a geotechnical engineering report including subsurface site work, laboratory testing, an evaluation of site soil conditions, a recommendation for the type of foundations to be used and an allowable design value for the soil-bearing capacity. 
A geologic and earthquake hazard report shall be submitted with the application for all new school sites, and for all con­struction on existing school sites located in a Seismic Hazard Zone, an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone, or in a seismic hazard zone designated in the Safety Element of a Local Gen­eral Plan. DSA may require a geologic and earthquake hazard study for any construction on a school site outside of the boundaries of any geologic hazard zone where a potential geo­logic hazard has been previously identified. 
Reports shall be prepared, and signed by a California-certi­fied engineering geologist and a California-registered geotechnical engineer. Geologic hazard reports shall include an evaluation of the potential for damage due to flooding. 
No school building shall be constructed, rehabilitated, reconstructed or relocated within 50 feet of the trace of an active fault, which has experienced surface displacement within Holocene time (approximately 11,000 years). 
(f) Estimates of cost. Estimates ofcost shall be based on the cost prevailing at the time the plans and specifications are sub­mitted to DSA. The estimated cost of a project shall be increased as necessary to include the estimated cost of every alternate building or portion thereof shown on the plans or specifications as if each alternate building and portion were to be constructed separately and simultaneously. 
For projects using the collaborative process for project review per Education Code Section 17319 or 81133.1, the estimated cost ofthe project shall be based on the cost prevailing at the time that the application is submitted. Upon submittal of complete plans and specifications, DSA may require the applicant to revise the estimated cost based on prevailing costs at that time. If the estimated cost has increased, the applicant shall submit addi­tional filing fees based on the revised estimated cost. 
When a contract amount, or the cumulative total of two or more contract amounts, exceeds the estimated cost by more than 30 percent, the estimated cost may be revised. An addi­tional fee, ifrequired, based on the revised estimated cost of the revision shall be paid before proceeding with the work. When the actual cost of constructing all the work shown on the approved plans is less than 70 percent of the estimated cost, a refund of overpaid fees may be claimed. (See Section 4-322 for actual cost and Section 4-325 for billing for further fees.) 
II (g) Deferred submittals. Only where a portion of the con­struction cannot be adequately detailed on the approved plans because of variations in product design and/or manufacturer, the approval of plans for such portion, when specifically accepted by DSA, may be deferred until the material suppliers are selected, provided the following conditions are met: 
II 
1. The project plans clearly indicate that DSA approval of 
the deffered submittal is required for the indicated por­
tions of the work prior to fabrication and installation. 
2. The project plans and specifications adequately describe the performance and loading criteria for such work. 
3. 	A California licensed architect or California registered engineer stamps and signs the plans and specifications for the deferred submittal item. The architect or engineer II in general responsible charge of the design of the project shall submit the plans and specifications for the deferred submittal item to DSA, with notation indicating that the 
II 

deferred submittal documents have been found to be in general conformance with the design of the building. 
4. Fabrication of deferred submittal items shall not begin II without first obtaining the approval of plans and specifi­cations by DSA. 
(h) Signatures required. The original signature sheet for the specifications and all plans, submitted for approval shall < bear the stamp and signature of the architect or professional engineer in general responsible charge of the design of the pro­ject. 
When responsibility for a portion of the work has been dele­gated, the plans and the original cover sheet for the specifica-< tions covering that portion ofthe design shall bear the signature and stamp of the responsible professional engineer or architect to whom the work has been delegated as well as that of the architect or engineer in general responsible charge. As an option, the architect or engineer in general responsible charge may sign the documents with notation indicating that the docu­ments have been coordinated with the design documents and found to be in general conformance with the design.

4-318. Procedure for approval of application and voidance of application. 
(a) General. After DSA has completed its check of the docu­ments submitted with the application, the checked prints of the plans and specifications, with the items marked for corrections and/or requests for additional information noted thereon, shall be returned to the responsible architect or registered engineer. When plans and/or specifications require extensive correc­tions, a corrected set of prints of the plans and specifications shall be submitted for review if requested by DSA. 
When the requested corrections have been made and/or the additional information has been provided by the responsible architect or registered engineer, an employee representative of the architect or registered engineer shall return the check set of plans and specifications along with the original plan tracings, the corrected specification pages and specification master cover sheet to DSA for backchecking. The backcheck is a com­parison of the corrected plans and specifications with the check set of plans and specifications and shall be accomplished by either a conference between a knowledgeable employee repre­sentative or the architect or registered engineer in general responsible charge and the checking engineer, or by mail in the case of minor corrections to which all parties have agreed. 
2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE 

Changes in plans and specifications, other than changes nec­essary for correction, made after submission for approval, shall be brought to the attention of DSA in writing or by submission ofrevised plans identifying those changes clearly at the time of back-checking. Failure to give such notice may result in the voidance of any subsequent approval given to the plans and specifications. 
All requested corrections shall be made, additional requested information furnished or original design justified prior to or at the time ofthe backcheck. When DSA deems that the corrected plans and specifications comply with these regu­lations and those parts of Title 24, CCR, that pertain to public school construction, DSA shall place its stamp on the repro­ducible sheets of drawings and master cover sheet of the specifications. The stamped drawings and specifications will be temporarily retained by DSA so that a record set can be created. DSA may charge a fee to the school district to recover the costs of creating the record set. 
(b) 
Approval of application. DSA shall issue to the school district a letter approving the application for the project within five working days of stamping the approved plans and specifi­cations. This letter shall constitute the "written approval of the plans, as to safety ofdesign and construction" required by Sec­tions 17297 and 81134, Education Code, before letting a con­tract for any construction. (See Section 4-330 for construction time limitations.) 

(c) 
Voidance of application. Any change, erasure, alter­ation or modification of any plans or specification bearing the stamp of DSA may result in voidance of the approval of the application. However, the "written approval of plans" may be extended by DSA to include revised plans and specifications after documents are submitted for review and approved. (See Section 4-323 for revised plans and Section 4-338 for addenda and construction changes.) 


The procedures leading to written approval of plans shall be carried to conclusion without suspension or unnecessary delay. At the discretion of DSA, the entire application may be voided where either (1) prints from corrected plans or cor­rected original plans are not filed for backcheck within 6 months after the date of return of checked plans to the archi­tect or engineer, or (2) at the discretion of DSA, any remain­ing unapproved increment(s) of the application may be voided when more than six months have elapsed since the last approval of an increment has been issued, and subsequent incremental plans and specifications have not been received by DSA for checking. 
For voided applications, upon request by the school district, 30 percent of the paid fee will be refunded; however, no refund will be allowed for projects upon which only the minimum fee has been paid, or upon which only an increment was voided.

4-322. Project cost. For purposes of detetmining fees, both the estimated and actual costs of the project shall be the total outlay for all work included in the approved plans and specifications (exclusive of fees paid, but not recovered, for architectural, engi­neeling, inspection and testing services) regardless of whether the funds are provided by the school district, by other public or plivate agencies or by individuals. The cost shall include any moving or relocation. In the event a building is converted to school use (see Section 4-306) the cost shall include the current replacement cost of the building. The current replacement cost shall be computed by multiplying an appropriate square foot cost by the total square foot area of the building being converted to school use. Ifwork is done in portions the actual cost shall be detetmined at the comple­tion of each contract. (See Section 4-325.) 
The estimated cost and the fee based thereon shall not be amended after plan check has started except as provided by Section 4-317(f) or for permissible increase in scope ofproject. The scope of a project shall not be amended after bids for all or part of the project are opened. No portion of the fee can be returned after checking has been started except as provided by Sections 4-317(f) and 4-319. 
Actual cost shall include all items which are normally con­sidered to be contractor's operation costs such as district-fur­nished labor and materials, bond, insurance and use of district facilities, and shall not he reduced hy charge-hacks such as those for testing, inspection or ovetTun of contract time. All fees and/or reimbursable charges paid to construction manag­ers shall be included in the actual cost of construction. When the contract for the work includes items not otherwise subject to the approval of DSA and not included in the approved plans and specifications the actual cost shall include this work unless such costs are segregated by separate bid items or by separately priced items of change orders, or by a certified copy of a sub­contractor's bid.

4-335. Structural tests and special inspections. 
(a) General. Structural tests and special inspections are required as set forth in these regulations and Part 2 of Title 24, 
C.C.R. 
Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance with any of the provisions of Title 24, C.C.R., or evidence that any material or construction does not conform to the requirements of Title 24, C.C.R., DSA may require tests/inspections as proof of compliance to be made at no expense to DSA. 
Test/inspection methods shall be as specified by Title 24, 
C.C.R. and by applicable referenced standards, as listed in Chapter 35 of Part 2 of Title 24, C.C.R. If there are no recog­nized and accepted test/inspection methods, the responsible architect or structural engineer shall submit written alternate test/inspection procedures for review and acceptance by DSA. 
The school board shall, with the advice of the responsible architect or structural engineer, select the laboratory of record, acceptable to DSA in accordance with Section 4-335.1, to con­duct all required tests for the project, and special inspections which are contracted to the laboratory of record. The labora­tory of record shall be directly employed by the school board and not be in the employ of any other agency or individual. 
All tests shall be made by a laboratory acceptable to DSA, as described in Section 4-335.1. Where job conditions warrant, the responsible architect or structural engineer may waive cer-

tain tests with the approval of DSA. The responsible architect or structural engineer shall prepare a statement of structural tests and special inspections, obtain DSA approval and provide a copy of the approved statement of structural tests and special inspections to the laboratory of record and the project inspector prior to the start of construction. 
(b) Payments. The school board shall pay for all tests/ inspections, but if so specified the amount or a portion thereof may be collected from the contractor by the school board. When in the opinion of the architect or registered engineer, additional tests/inspections are required because of the manner in which the contractor executes his or her work, such tests/inspections shall be paid for by the schoolboard, but if so specified the amount paid may be collected from the contractor by the school board. Examples of such tests/inspection are: tests of material substituted for previously accepted materials, retests or re-inspections made necessary by the failure of material to comply with the requirements of the approved con­struction documents and specifications, and load tests neces­sary because certain portions of the structure have not fully met specification or plan requirements. 
(c) Sampling and testing of materials. Samples or speci­mens of material for testing shall be taken by a qualified repre­sentative of the laboratory of record. For a minor scope of work, the project inspector may, if qualified and other duties permit, be authorized in writing by DSA to obtain, handle, pre­pare, protect, transport, and/or store test specimens. 
In general, samples may be selected at random; however, if there is reason to believe that specific materials may be defec­tive, sample locations may be selected by the project inspector, responsible architect or structural engineer or DSA representa-

tive. In no case shall the contractor or vendor select the sample location or obtain specimens. 
Obtaining, handling, preparing, protecting, transporting or storing of samples and testing shall be in accordance with the standards as provided for in the approved plans, specifications and in the applicable building regulations. 
In cases where a tested sample has failed to meet the require­ments of the DSA approved documents, the responsible archi­tect or structural engineer, subject to the approval ofDSA, may permit retest of the material or in-place work. 
(d) Test reporting requirements. 
1. 	
The laboratory of record shall complete detailed test reports outlining all structural material tests. Report for­mat shall be as prescribed by DSA. 

2. 	
Reports shall include all tests made, regardless of whether such tests indicate that the material is satisfac­tory or nonconforming. 

3. 	
The reports shall clearly state that the material or materi­als were sampled and tested in accordance with the requirements ofthese regulations and the approved plans and specifications. Reports shall also clearly state whether or not the material or materials tested met the requirements of the DSA approved documents. 

4. 
All reports of tests performed on-site shall be submitted to the project inspector on the day the tests were per­formed. 

5. 
Within 14 days of the date of any material test, the labo­ratory of record shall submit all such test reports to the design professional in general responsible charge, the structural engineer, the project inspector, and the school district. 

6. 	
Reports of material tests not conforming with the requirements of the DSA approved documents shall be forwarded immediately to DSA, the design professional in general responsible charge, the structural engineer, the project inspector, and the school district. 



(e) Verified reports by the laboratory ofrecord. The labo­ratory of record shall submit a verified report to DSA, and pro­vide a copy to the design professional(s), the school board and the project inspector, covering all of the tests and special inspections that were required to be made by that laboratory. Such report shall be furnished within 14 days of the completion of the testing/special inspection program, whenever required by DSA, or any time that work on the project is suspended, or services of the laboratory of record are terminated. The report shall cover the tests and special inspections completed at that time. 
The verified report shall be signed, under penalty of perjury, by the California registered civil engineer charged with engi­neering managerial responsibility for the laboratory of record. The verified report shall state that the structural tests and spe­cial inspections required by the DSA approved documents were made. The report shall include a list of any noncompliant material or inspected work that has not been resolved by the date of the verified report. Any required tests or special inspec­tion work that were not conducted by the laboratory of record 
SAFETY OF CONSTRUCTION OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS

The project inspector must have actual personal knowledge, obtained by personal and continuous inspection of the work of con­struction in all stages of its progress, that the requirements of the approved plans and specifications are being com­pletely executed. 
Continuous inspection means complete inspection of every part of the work. Work, such as concrete work or masonry work which can be inspected only as it is placed, shall require the constant presence of the inspec­tor. Other types of work which can be completely inspected after the work is installed may be carried on while the inspector is not present. In any case, the inspec­tor must personally inspect every part of the work. In no case shall the inspector have or assume any duties that will prevent the inspector from giving continuous inspection. DSA may require verification from the pro­ject inspector of time spent at the construction site during all phases of the work. 

The project inspector may obtain personal knowledge ofthe work ofconstruction, either on-site or off-site, per­formed under the inspection of special inspectors and/or assistant inspectors (Section 4-333). The project inspec­tor may obtain personal knowledge that materials used in the construction conform to the DSA approved docu­ments by verifying test reports performed by DSA accepted testing facilities, verifying materials certifica­tions shipped with the materials, or other means as speci­fied in the DSA approved documents and referenced codes and standards. The project inspector shall be responsible for monitoring the work of the special inspectors and testing laboratories to ensure that the test­ing program is satisfactorily completed. The project inspector shall be responsible for supervising the work of all assistant inspectors in accordance with Section 
II 	4-333(d). The exercise of reasonable diligence to obtain the facts shall be required. 
2. 	Relations with architect or engineer. Any uncertain­ties in the inspector's comprehension of the plans and specifications or inconsistencies or seeming errors in the 
II 	approved construction documents shall be reported promptly to the architect or registered engineer for inter­pretation and instructions. In no case shall the instruction of the architect or registered engineer be construed to cause work to be done which is not in conformity with the DSA approved documents. 
3. 	Job file. The project inspector shall keep and maintain a file on the job at all times with all of the following: 
A. DSA approved plans and specifications including DSA approved addenda and all construction change documents. 
B. Applicable parts of the edition of Title 24, C.C.R., referred to in the plans and specifications, and any pertinent reference standards. 
C. DSA approved statement 	of structural tests and special inspections. 
D. Copies of project inspector's semi-monthly reports. 

II E. Copies ofall deviation notices and a log ofall de vi­ation notices. The log shall reference all applicable details and specification sections related to nonconforming materials and workmanship including field change documents, change orders, addenda and deferred submittals. The log shall 
II 
describe all conective actions taken whether per­formed in accordance with DSA approved docu­ments or not, the current status of each deviation issue and the resolution for each issue. 
F. Log documenting all significant communications 

II 
with the design professionals, contractors, DSA rep­resentatives and other persons involved in the pro­ject. Significant communications include, but are not limited to, interpretations, clarifications or directions from the design professionals, issues identified by DSA representatives, directives from the school district, and start notices from the contractor.

G. Laboratory tests and inspection reports. 
H. Contractor's request for information (RFI) and responses to the RFis. 
I. 	Interpretations and clarifications from the design II professional in general responsible charge. 
J. 	Special inspection reports. 
K. Concrete placing operation records showing the time and date of placing concrete and the time and date of removal of forms in each portion of the structure. 
L. Welding operation records including identifica-	II tion marks of welders, lists of defective welds, manner of correction of defects, etc. 
M.Pile driving operation records including penetra-II tion under the last 10 blows for each pile when piles are driven for foundations. 
N. Verified reports for all persons required by this code to file verified reports. 
0. Any other applicable documents required to pro­vide a complete record of construction. 
The job file shall be kept on the job site until the com­pletion of the project and shall be readily accessible to DSA personnel during site visits. A copy of the job file shall be made available to DSA upon request. The job file, with the exception of building codes and reference stan­dards, shall be made a part ofthe permanent school district records. 
4. 	
Project inspector's semimonthly reports. The project inspector shall keep the architect or registered engineer thoroughly informed as to the progress of the work by making semimonthly reports in writing as required in Section 4-337.

SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS 
an SPC-1 building may be granted an Administrative Extension by the Office. 
8.4. Risk-Based Extension. The risk-based extension is based on the seismic risk coefficient. 
(a) 	The seismic risk coefficient posed by a building, P, shall be determined by: 
P=HXE 
Where: 
H = the value of the collapse probability in percent, as determined by the require­ments of Section 1.8; and, 
E = the Exposure Factor, based on the pres­ence of Basic and Supplemental Ser­vices, as defined in Part 2, Title 24, Section 1224.3. 
The Exposure Factor E shall be taken as: 
E =	0.5 where the building houses only storage spaces, central ster­ile supply spaces, and/or utility plant spaces. 
E = 0.7 where the building houses only clinical laboratory, pharma­ceutical, dietetic and/or support services spaces, or nonpatient care building which is contiguous to and provides egress or struc­tural support to an acute care hos­pital building(s). 
E = 	1.0 where the building houses any other Basic and/or Supple­mentary Service spaces. 
Where a building contains more than one Basic and/or Supplementary Service space, the largest value ofE shall apply. 
(b) 	The Risk-Based Extension is determined by the seismic risk coefficient, P: 
i. 	Where P ::::; 3.0%, the Risk-Based Extension for the building shall not exceed seven years. 
ii. Where P > 3.0% but P::::; 5.0%, the Risk-Based Extension for the build­ing shall not exceed five years. 
iii. Where P > 5.0%, the Risk-Based Extension for the building shall not exceed two years. 
iv. Regardless 	of the seismic coeffi­cient, P, the Risk-Based Extension for any building straddling an Active Fault shall not exceed two years. 
8.5. Community access to essential hospital services. The potential effect of closure of the hospital building on community access to essential hospi­tal services shall be evaluated.

2.1.2 Data collection. Building information pertinent to a structure's seismic performance, including condition, configu­ration, detailing, material strengths and foundation type, shall be obtained in accordance with this section, and documented on drawings and/or sketches that shall be included with the structural calculations. 
Exception: Materials testing is not required for reclassifica­tion by the collapse probability assessment option as per­mitted by Section 1.4.5.1.2, where nonavailability of materials test is identified as a deficiency per Section 
1.4.5.1.2.2.2.2 
(b). 

2.1.2.1 
Building characteristics. Characteristics of the build­ing relevant to its seismic performance shall be obtained for use in the building evaluation. This shall include current informa­tion on the building's condition, configuration, material strengths, detailing and foundation type. This data shall be obtained from: 


1. 	
Review of construction documents; 

2. 	
Destructive and nondestructive testing and examination of selected building components; and 

3. 	
Field observation of exposed conditions. 


The characteristics of the building shall be established, including identification of the gravity-and lateral-load-catTy­ing systems. The effective lateral-load canying system may include structural and nonstructural elements that will partici­pate in providing lateral resistance, although these elements may not have intended to provide lateral resistance. The load path shall be identified, taking into account the effects of any modifications, alterations or additions. 
2.1.2.1.1 Nonconforming buildings without construction documents. Where the available construction documents do not provide sufficient detail to characterize the structure, the evaluation may be based on field surveys, summarized in as-built drawings. These drawings must depict building dimen­sions, component sizes, reinforcing information (for concrete and masonry elements), connection details, footing informa­tion, and the proximity of neighboring structures. All parts of the building that may contribute to the seismic resistance or that may be affected by the seismic response of the structure must be identified. The field survey shall establish the physical exis­tence of the structural members, and identify critical load bear­ing members, transfer mechanisms, and connections. The sur­vey shall include information on the structural elements and connector materials and details. Performing the field survey will entail removal of fireproofing or concrete encasement at critical locations to permit direct visual inspection and mea­surement of elements and connections. Nondestructive tech­niques such as radiographic, electromagnetic and other methods may be used to supplement destructive techniques.

Steel elements. Steel elements shall be classified by structural member type (e.g., rolled or build-up, material grade, and general properties). The survey shall note the presence of degradation or indications of plastic defor­mation, integrity of surface coatings, and signs of any past movement. For degraded elements, the lost material thickness and reduction of cross-sectional area and moment of inertia shall be determined. Visual inspection of welds shall be per American Welding Society D 1.1, "Structural Welding Code-Steel." Structural bolts shall be verified to be in proper configuration and tightened as required in the AISC Steel Construction Manual. Rivets shall also be verified to be in proper configuration and in full contact, with "hammer sounding" conducted on ran­dom rivets to ensure they are functional. Nondestructive testing methods, such as dye penetrant and magnetic par­ticle testing, acoustic emission, radiography and ultra­sound shall be used when visual inspection identifies degradation or when a particular element or connection is critical to seismic resistance and requires further veri­fication. For buildings in which archaic cast and wrought irons are employed, additional investigations to confirm ductility and impact resistance shall be conducted. 

2. 	
Concrete elements. The configuration and dimensions of primary and secondary structural elements shall be established. The configuration and condition ofreinforc­ing steel shall be assessed, through removal of concrete cover and direct visual inspection, and through nonde­structive inspection using electromagnetic, radiographic and other methods. Critical parameters of the reinforcing system, such as lap splice length, presence of hooks, development within concrete, degree of corrosion and integrity of the construction shall be established in suffi­cient detail to perform the structural evaluation. 


2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE 
3. 	
Masonry elements. The configuration and dimensions ofmasonry elements shall be established. The configura­tion and condition of reinforcing-steel shall be assessed, through removal of masonry cover and direct visual inspection, and through nondestructive inspection using electromagnetic, radiographic and other methods. Criti­cal parameters of the reinforcing system, such as lap splice length, presence of hooks, development within concrete, degree of corrosion and integrity of the con­struction shall be established in sufficient detail to per­form the structural evaluation. 

4. 	
Wood elements. The configuration and dimensions of wood elements; the connections between wood ele­ments; and the connections between wood and other structural components or elements such as concrete or masonry walls shall be established. The configuration and condition of wood members, including size, type, grade, condition and quality shall be assessed, through removal of finish materials, and examination of unfin­ished areas such as attics, crawl spaces and basements. Critical connections and elements shall be visually inspected, using invasive procedures or removal of fin­ishes where necessary. For shear walls, select locations shall be exposed to allow evaluation of sheathing mate­rial, nail size, spacing and installation (e.g., overdriven or nails that miss or split the framing members). The base connections of shear resisting elements shall be inspected and evaluated for their adequacy to connect the base ofthe structure to the foundation or structure below. 

5. 	
Foundation elements. In the absence of dependable construction drawings, determination of the size and detailing of the foundation system requires invasive pro­cedures. The evaluator shall select representative foot­ings for exposure to establish footing size and depth. Conservative assumptions regarding the reinforcement may be made considering code requirements and local practice at the time of the design. In the absence of evi­dence to the contrary, it may be assumed that the founda­tion elements were adequately designed to resist actual gravity loads to which the building has been subjected. 



2.1.2.2 Material properties. The building evaluation shall be based on the strength and deformation properties of the exist­ing materials and components. The strength ofexisting compo­nents shall be calculated using data on their configuration, obtained from the original construction documents, supple­mented by field observations and the test values of material properties. Where such effects may have a deleterious effect on component or structural behavior, allowances shall be made for the likely effects ofstrain hardening or degradation. Test values may be obtained from samples extracted from the structure, or from original materials and compliance certificates. The Office will determine the adequacy of the testing program. 
2.1.2.2.1 Nonconforming buildings with construction docu­ments. The material properties for nonconforming buildings for which original construction documents of sufficient detail are available shall be confirmed by testing or from acceptable 
SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS 
original materials and compliance certificates. If original materials and compliance certificates are available, they must provide the information specified in Items 1 through 4 of this section to be considered acceptable. 
1. 	Steel elements. The following properties are required for each member type (e.g., beams, columns, braces) and each steel grade used in the structure: 
a) 	Ultimate tensile and yield capacities; 
b) Modulus of elasticity; and 
c) 	Deformation characteristics including mode of failure. 

2. 	Concrete elements. The following material properties are required for each member type (e.g., beams, col­umns, walls) in the structure: 
a) Concrete compressive strength; 
b) Concrete unit weight; 
c) Concrete modulus of elasticity; 
d) Reinforcing steel tensile yield point; 
e) Reinforcing steel modulus of elasticity; 
f) Reinforcing steel chemical composition and car­

bon equivalent; and g) Reinforcing steel surface deformations. 

3. 	
Masonry elements. The following material properties are required for each type of masonry in the structure: a) Masonry compressive strength; b) Masonry unit weight; c) Masonry modulus of elasticity; d) Reinforcing steel tensile yield point; e) Reinforcing steel modulus of elasticity; f) Reinforcing steel chemical composition and car­

bon equivalent; and g) Reinforcing steel surface deformations. 


4. 	
Wood elements. The following material properties are required for each type ofwood element in the structure: 


a) 	Identification of Wood Species, and 
b) Grade Material. (Note: This may be established by visual inspection or stamped labels on the ele­ment.) 

2.1.2.2.2 Nonconforming buildings without construction documents. The material properties for nonconforming build­ings for which original construction documents of sufficient detail are unavailable shall be confirmed by testing. The num­ber and location of tests shall be selected so as to provide suffi­cient information to adequately define the existing condition of materials in the building. The evaluator shall determine the number and location of tests. The test locations shall be located throughout the entire building in those components which pro­vide the primary path of lateral force resistance. 
2.2 Selection and use of evaluation statements. 
2.2.1 Identification of building type. The evaluator shall determine the building type using the following procedure: 
1. 	
Identify the lateral-force-resisting system using text and drawings, including whatever components are available and effective to constitute a system. Prepare floor and roof plans, and elevations and sketches of the lat­eral-force-resisting system. 

2. 	
Select one or more of the 15 common building types which best characterize the structure (see Sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 below). Structures with multiple lateral force resisting systems (different lateral systems in orthogonal directions, or structures where the system changes from level to level) may require the use of two or more build­ing types. In the case of hybrid structures or other build­ings that cannot be adequately classified using the 15 building types, the alternative analysis procedure shall be used, or the building shall be placed in SPC "1." 

3. 	
Reproduce from the Appendix the list of evaluation statements. These statements shall be used for all types of buildings. Some statements on the list may not be appropriate. These statements may be marked "NA" as "not applicable." The Appendix also contains the set of evaluation statements that address foundations and geo­logic site hazards, and nonstructural elements. 


2.2.2 Using the general procedure. The general procedure involving use of the set of evaluation statements presented in the Appendix consists of the following steps: 
1. 	
Evaluate the basic building system according to the eval­uation statements in Article 3; 

2. 	
Evaluate the vertical systems resisting lateral forces according to Article 4 (moment frames), Article 5 (shear walls) or Article 6 (braced frames) as appropriate. For buildings with a combination of vertical systems, each system in the building must be evaluated; 

3. 	
Evaluate the diaphragm or horizontal bracing system according to Article 7; 

4. 	
Evaluate the structural connections according to Article 8; 

5. 	
Evaluate the foundation and possible geologic site haz­ards according to Article 9; 

6. 	
Evaluate the nonstructural elements that involve imme­diate life-safety issues according to Article 10; and 

7. 	
Evaluate the critical nonstructural components and sys­tems according to Article 11. 


Ifa statement is found to be true, the condition being evalu­ated is acceptable according to the criteria of these regulations, and the issue may be set aside. If a statement is found to be false, a condition exists that needs to be addressed further, using the specified analysis procedures. Analysis procedures are given in Section 2.4. Each statement includes a reference to a particular section in Articles 3 through 10 where additional procedures for the resolution of the issues are given. The evalu­ator shall assemble the list of deficiencies and the results of the analysis and proceed to the final evaluation in Section 2.5. 
2.2.3 Common building types. The evaluator shall determine the type(s) of building being evaluated, choosing from among the following 15 common types: 
1. 	
Building Type 1-Wood, light frame. These build­ings are typically small structures of one or more sto­ries. The essential structural character of this type is repetitive framing by wood joists on wood studs. Loads are light and spans are small. These buildings may have relatively heavy chimneys and may be partially or fully covered with veneer. Lateral loads are transferred by diaphragms to shear walls. The diaphragms are roof panels and floors. Shear walls are exterior walls sheathed with plank siding, stucco, plywood, gypsum board, particle board or fiberboard. Interior partitions are sheathed with plaster or gypsum board. 

2. 	
Building Type 2-Wood, commercial and indus­trial. These are buildings with a floor area of 5,000 square feet or more and with few, if any, interior bear­ing walls. The essential structural character is framing by beams on columns. The beams may be glulam beams, steel beams or trusses. Lateral forces usually are resisted by wood diaphragms and exterior walls sheathed with plywood, stucco, plaster or other panel­ing. The walls may have rod bracing. Large exterior wall openings often require post-and-beam framing. Lateral force resistance on those lines may be achieved with steel rigid frames or diagonal bracing. 

3. 	
Building Type 3-Steel moment frame. These build­ings have a frame of steel columns and beams. Lateral forces are resisted by the development of flexural forces in the beams and columns. In some cases, the beam-column connections have very small moment resisting capacity but, in other cases, the connections of some of the beams and columns were designed to fully develop the member capacities. Lateral loads are trans­ferred by diaphragms to moment resisting frames. The diaphragms can be of almost any material. The frames develop their stiffness by full or partial moment con­nections. The frames can be located almost anywhere in the building. Usually the columns have their strong directions oriented so that some columns act primarily in one direction while the others act in the other direc­tion, and the frames consist of lines of strong columns and their intervening beams. 

4. 	
Building Type 4-Steel braced frame. These build­ings are similar to Type 3 buildings except that the ver­tical components of the lateral-force-resisting system are braced frames rather than moment frames. 

5. 	
Building Type 5-Steellight frame. These buildings are pre-engineered and prefabricated with transverse rigid frames. The roof and walls consist of lightweight panels. The frames are built in segments and assembled in the field with bolted joints. Lateral loads in the trans­verse direction are resisted by the rigid frames with loads distributed to them by shear elements. Loads in the longitudinal direction are resisted entirely by shear elements. The shear elements can be either the roof and wall sheathing panels, an independent system of ten­


2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE 
sion-only rod bracing, or a combination of panels and bracing. 
6. 	
Building Type 6-Steel frame with concrete shear walls. The shear walls in these buildings are cast-in-place concrete and may be bearing walls. The steel frame is designed for vertical loads only. Lateral loads are transferred by diaphragms of almost any material to the shear walls. The steel frame may pro­vide a secondary lateral-force-resisting system depending on the stiffness of the frame and the moment capacity of the beam-column connections. In "dual" systems, the steel moment frames are designed to work together with the concrete shear walls in proportion to their relative rigidities. In this case, the walls would be evaluated under this building type and the frames would be evaluated under Type 3, Steel Moment Frames. 

7. 	
Building Type 7-Steel frame with infill shear walls. This is one of the older type of buildings. The infill walls usually are offset from the exterior frame members, wrap around them, and present a smooth masonry exterior with no indication of the frame. Sol­idly infilled masonry panels act as a diagonal compres­sion strut between the intersections of the moment frame. Ifthe walls do not fully engage the frame mem­bers (i.e., lie in the same plane), the diagonal compres­sion struts will not develop. The peak strength of the diagonal strut is determined by the tensile stress capac­ity of the masonry panel. The post-cracking strength is determined by an analysis of a moment frame that is partially restrained by the cracked infill. The analysis shall be based on published research and shall treat the system as a composite of a frame and the infill. An anal­ysis that attempts to treat the system as a frame and shear wall is not permitted. 

8. 	
Building Type 8-Concrete moment frame. These buildings are similar to Type 3 buildings except that the frames are of concrete. There is a large variety of frame systems. Older buildings may have frame beams that have broad shallow cross sections or are simply the col­umn strips of flat-slabs. 

9. 	
Building Type 9-Concrete shear walls. The vertical components of the lateral-force-resisting system in these buildings are concrete shear walls that are usually bearing walls. In older buildings, the walls often are quite extensive and the wall stresses are low but rein­forcing is light. Remodeling that entailed adding or enlarging the openings for windows and doors may critically alter the strength of the modified walls. In newer buildings, the shear walls often are limited in extent, generating the need for boundary members and additional design consideration of overturning forces. 

10. 	
Building Type 10-Concrete frame with infill shear walls. These hnilciines :we similar to Type 7 buildings except that the frame is of reinforced concrete. The analysis of this building is similar to that recommended for Type 7 except that the shear strength of the concrete columns, after cracking ofthe infill, may limit the semi-



SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS 
ductile behavior of the system. Research that is specific to confinement of the infill by reinforced concrete frames shall be used for the analysis. 

11. 	
Building Type 11-Precast/tilt-up concrete walls with lightweight flexible diaphragm. These build­ings have a wood or metal deck roof diaphragm that distributes lateral forces to precast concrete shear walls. The walls are thin but relatively heavy while the roofs are relatively light. Tilt-up buildings often have more than one story. Walls can have numerous open­ings for doors and windows of such size that the wall behaves more like a frame than a shear wall. 

12. 	
Building Type 12-Precast concrete frames with concrete shear walls. These buildings contain floor and roof diaphragms typically composed of precast concrete elements with or without cast-in-place con­crete topping slabs. The diaphragms are supported by precast concrete girders and columns. The girders often bear on column corbels. Closure strips between precast floor elements and beam-column joints usually are cast-in-place concrete. Welded steel inserts often are used to interconnect precast elements. Lateral loads are resisted by precast or cast-in-place concrete shear walls. 

13. 	
Building Type 13-Reinforced masonry bearing walls with wood or metal deck diaphragms. These buildings have perimeter bearing walls of reinforced brick or concrete-block masonry. These walls are the vertical elements in the lateral-force-resisting system. The floors and roofs are framed either with wood joists and beams with plywood or straight or diagonal sheath­ing or with steel beams with metal deck with or without a concrete fill. Wood floor framing is supported by interior wood posts or steel columns; steel beams are supported by steel columns. 

14. 	
Building Type 14-Reinforced masonry bearing walls with precast concrete diaphragms. These buildings have bearing walls similar to those of Type 13 buildings, but the roof and floors are composed of precast concrete elements such as planks or tee-beams, and the precast roof and floor elements are supported on interior beams and columns of steel or concrete (cast-in-place or precast). The precast horizontal ele­ments may have a cast-in-place topping. 

15. 	
Building Type 15-Unreinforced masonry (URM) bearing wall buildings. These buildings include struc­tural elements that vary depending on the building's age and, to a lesser extent, its geographic location. In build­ings built before 1900, the majority of floor and roof construction consists of wood sheathing supported by wood subframing. In large multistory buildings, the floors are cast-in-place concrete supported by the unreinforced masonry walls and/or steel or concrete interior framing. In buildings built after 1950, unreinforced masonry buildings with wood floors usu­ally have plywood rather than board sheathing. The perimeter walls, and possibly some interior walls, are unreinforced masonry. The walls may or may not be 


anchored to the diaphragms. Ties between the walls and diaphragms are more common for the bearing walls than for walls that are parallel to the floor fram­ing. Unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings (TYPE 15) shall be assigned to SPC 1. No further anal­ysis is required. 

2.3 Follow-up field work. The first assessment of the evalua­tion statements may indicate a need for more information about the building. The evaluator shall make additional site visits, performing the necessary surveys and tests to complete the evaluation. 
2.4 Analysis of the building. The general requirements for building analysis (including the determination of force level, horizontal distribution of lateral forces, accidental torsion, interstory drift and overturning) are summarized in this sec­tion. For cases where dynamic analysis is required, the general requirements are given in Section 2.4.10. 
2.4.1 Scope of analysis. When an evaluation statement is false and requires further analysis, the evaluator shall provide appro­priate analyses that will cover the statement requirements. For the analysis, the evaluator will: 
1. 	
Calculate the building weights; 

2. 	
Calculate the building period; 

3. 	
Calculate the lateral force on the building; 

4. 
Distribute the lateral force over the height of the build­ing; 

5. 	
Calculate the story shears and overturning moments; 

6. 	
Distribute the story shears to the vertical resisting ele­ments in proportion to their relative stiffness; 

7. 	
Examine the individual elements as required by the eval­uation statements: 


a. 	
Load and reaction diagrams for diaphragms and for the vertical resisting elements; 

b. 
Shearing stresses 	and chord forces in the dia­phragm; 

c. 	
Vertical components (walls and frames) and find the story deflections, member forces and deflec­tions; and 

d. 	
Total forces or deflections according to the speci­fied load combinations. 



For moment frames consisting of beams and columns, the distribution ofstory shears to the vertical lateral-force-resisting elements in that story may be in proportion to their relative stiffness. In multistory frame-shear wall structures or in struc­tures where the vertical resisting elements have significantly different lateral stiffnesses, or where the stiffnesses ofthe verti­cal resisting elements change significantly over the height of the structure, an analysis of the entire structure under the pre­scribed lateral loads shall be performed. 
2.4.2 Demand. All building components evaluated shall resist the effects of the seismic forces prescribed herein and the effects of gravity loadings from dead, floor live and snow loads. The following load combinations shall be used: 
Q= 1.1 QD+ QL +Qs±QE (2-1) 
or (2-2) 

where: 
Q = 	the effect of the combined loads. 
Qv = 	the effect of dead load. 
QE = the effect of seismic forces. 
QL = 	the effective live load is equal to 25 percent of the unreduced design live load but not less than the actual live load. 
Q8 = the effective snow load is equal to either 70 percent of the full design snow load or, where conditions warrant and are approved by OSHPD, not less than 20 percent of the full design snow load except that, where the design snow load is less than 30 pounds per square foot, no part ofthe load need be included in seismic loading. 
The seismic portion of the demand (QE) is obtained from analysis of the building using the seismic base shear (V) from Equation 2-3. 
2.4.3 Seismic analysis of the building. 
2.4.3.1 Base shear. The seismic base shear determined from Equation 2-3 is the basic seismic demand on the building. Ele­ment forces and deflections obtained from analysis based on this demand are the element demands (QE) to be used in the load combinations of Equations 2-1 and 2-2. The demands are modified in some cases as discussed in Section 2.4.11. 
The seismic base shear (V) in a given direction shall be deter­mined as follows: 
V=C,W 	(2-3) 
where: 

Cs = the seismic design coefficient determined by Equation 2-4 or 2-5. 
W = the total dead load and applicable portions of the fol­lowing: 
• 	
In storage and warehouse occupancies, a minimum of 25 percent of the floor live; 

• 	
Where an allowance for partition load is included in the floor load design, the actual partition weight or a minimum weight of 10 psf of floor area, whichever is greater; 

• 	
Total operating weight of all permanent equipment; and 

• 	
The effective snow load as defined in Section 2.4.2.

The seismic coefficient (C) for existing buildings shall be determined as follows: 
C =0.67 (1.2AvS) = 0.80AvS (2_4) s RT2t3 RT2t3 

where: 
Av 	the peak velocity-related acceleration coefficient given in Figures 2.1 and 2.1 a. 
R = a response modification coefficient from Table 2.4.3 .1. 
S = the site coefficient given in Table 2.1. In locations where the soil properties are not known in sufficient detail to determine the Soil Profile Type S3 shall be used. Soil Profile Type S4 need not be assumed unless OSHPD determines that Soil Profile Type S4 may be present at the site, or in the event the Soil Profile Type S4 is established by the geotechnical engineer. 
T = the fundamental period of the building. 
The value of C, need not be greater than:

where: 
Aa = the effective peak acceleration coefficient given in Fig­ures 2.1 and 2.1a. 
2.4.3.2 Period. For use in Equation 2-4, the value ofT shall be calculated using one of the following methods: 
Method 1. The value of T may be taken to be equal to the approximate fundamental period of the building (T) deter­mined as follows: 
a. For buildings in which the lateral-force-resisting system consists of moment-resisting frames capable of resisting 100 percent of the required lateral force and such frames are not enclosed or adjoined by more rigid components tending to prevent the frames from deflecting when subjected to seismic forces: 

(2-6a) 

where: 
Cr = 0.035 for steel frames. 
Cr = 0.030 for concrete frames. 
h" = 	the height in feet above the base to the highest level of the building. 
h. As an alternate for concrete and steel moment-resist­ing-frame buildings of 12 stories or fewer with a minimum story height of 10 feet, the equation Ta =0.10N, where N= the number of stories, may be used in lieu of Equation 2-6a.

0.05hll 
(2-6b)
Ta 	= JL 

where:

Method 2. The fundamental period T may be estimated using the structural properties and deformational characteristics of the resisting elements in a properly substantiated analysis. This requirement may be satisfied by using the following equation: 
T = 2:rr L.(w A2) 
(2-7)
gL.(!;d;) 

The values of.f represent any lateral force, associated with weights wi, distributed approximately in accordance with the principles of Equations 2-8, 2-9 and 2-10 or any other rational distribution. The elastic deflections, d;, should be calculated using the applied lateral forces, .f. The period used for compu­tation of C, shall not exceed CaTa, where Ca is given in Table 
2.4.3.2. 
2.4.3.3 Direction of seismic forces. Assume that seismic forces will come from any horizontal direction. The forces may be assumed to act nonconcurrently in the direction ofeach prin­cipal axis of the structure except as discussed in Section 
2.4.3.5. 
2.4.3.4 Uplift. The beneficial effects of uplift at the foundation soil level may be considered, using the alternative analysis procedure. 
2.4.3.5 Orthogonal effects. The critical load effect due to direction of application of seismic forces on the building may be assumed to be satisfied if components and their foundations are designed for the following combination of prescribed loads: 100 percent of the forces for one direction plus 30 per­cent of the forces for the perpendicular direction. The combina­tion requiring the maximum component strength should be used. 
Exception: Diaphragms and components of the seismic resisting system utilized in only one of the two orthogonal directions need not be designed for the combined effects. 
2.4.3.6 Combinations ofstructural systems. When combina­tions of structural systems are incorporated into the same struc­ture, the following requirements shall be satisfied: 
1. 	Vertical combinations. 
1.1 	Structures not having the same structural system throughout their height shall be evaluated using the dynamic lateral force procedure. 
Exceptions: 
1. 	
Structures five stories or less without stiffness and strength irregularities may be evaluated using the equivalent lateral force procedures; and 

2. 	
Structures conforming to Section 2.4.3.6.2, below. 



1.2 	
A two-stage analysis may be used if a structure contains a relatively rigid base supporting a flexi­ble upper portion and both portions considered separately can be classified as regular structures. The rigid base shall have a calculated natural period in each direction of not more than 0.06 seconds. The periods shall be evaluated using Eq. 2-7, or its equivalent, considering the total mass of the flexible upper portion concentrated at the top of the rigid base. The flexible upper portion shall be evaluated as a separate structure sup­ported laterally by the rigid base. The rigid base shall be evaluated as a separate structure. The reactions of the flexible upper portion shall be applied at the top of the rigid base, amplified by the ratio of the Rand Cd factors of the superstruc­ture divided by those for the base structure. The values of R and Cd for the base structure shall be greater than or equal to those used for the super­structure. The total lateral force on the base shall include the forces determined for the base itself. 

2. 	
Combinations along different axes. If a building has a bearing wall system in only one direction, the value of R used for systems in the other direction shall not be greater than that used for the bearing wall system. 


2.4.3.7 Vertical distribution of forces. The lateral force (F), induced at any level, shall be determined as follows: 

(2-8) and (2-9) 
where: 

Cvx 	= vertical distribution factor. 
h;and 

h, 	= the height (feet) from the base to Level I or x. 
k = an exponent related to the building period as follows: For buildings having a period of 0.5 second or less, k = 1. 
For buildings having a period of2.5 seconds or more, k= 2. 
For buildings having a period between 0.5 and 2.5 sec­onds, k may be taken as 2 or may be determined by linear interpolation between 1 and 2. 
V = total design lateral force or shear at the base of the building. 
w;and 

w, = the portion of the total gravity load of the building (W) located or assigned to Level I or x. 
2.4.3.8 Horizontal distribution of shear. The story shear, (V), shall be distributed to the various vertical elements of the lateral-force-resisting system in proportion to their rigidities, considering the rigidity of the diaphragm. 
2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE 

SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS 
2.4.3.9 Horizontal torsional moments. The increased shears resulting from horizontal torsion where diaphragms have the capability to transmit that torsion shall be evaluated. The acci­dental torsional moment shall be determined assuming dis­placements of the centers of mass each way from their calculated locations. The minimum assumed displacement of the center of mass at each level shall be five percent of the dimension at that level measured perpendicular to the direction of the applied force. For each element, the most severe loading shall be considered. 
2.4.3.10 Overturning. Every structure shall be capable of resisting the overturning effects caused by earthquake forces specified. At any level, the overturning moments to be resisted shall be estimated using those seismic forces (F, and Fx) that act on levels above the level under consideration. At any level, the incremental changes of the overturning moment shall be dis­tributed to the various resisting elements in the same propor­tion as distribution of the horizontal shears to those elements. The foundations of buildings (but not the connection of the building to the foundation), except inverted pendulum struc­tures, shall be evaluated for the foundation overturning design moment (M1) at the foundation-soil interface determined using the overturning moment at the base with an overturning moment reduction factor of 0.75. 
2.4.3.11 P-delta effects. The resulting member forces and moments and the story drifts induced by P-delta effects shall be considered in the evaluation of overall structural frame stabil­ity. P-delta need not be considered if the drift satisfies the "Quick Check for Drift" given in Section 2.4.7. 
2.4.3.12 Foundations. The foundation shall be capable of transmitting the base shear and the overturning forces defined in this article from the structure into the supporting soil. The short-term dynamic nature of the loads may be taken into account in establishing the soil properties. 
2.4.3.12.1 Soil capacities. The capacity of the foundation soil in bearing or the capacity of the soil interface between pile, pier or caisson and the soil shall be sufficient to support the struc­ture with all prescribed loads, other than earthquake forces, taking due account of the settlement that the structure is capa­ble of withstanding. For the load combination including earth­quake, the soil capacities must be sufficient to resist loads at acceptable strains considering both the short time of loading and the dynamic properties of the soil. Allowable soil capaci­ties multiplied by a factor of2.0 may be used, except that values for sliding friction may not be increased. 
2.4.3.12.2 Structural materials. The strength of concrete foundation components subjected to seismic forces alone or in combination with other prescribed loads and their detailing requirements shall be determined from the provisions of ACI 
318. Reductions to foundation component capacities shall be made where components do not meet the requirements of ACI 
318. 
2.4.4 Deformation and drift. When deformations and drift limits need to be checked, such as for frames failing the "Quick Check of Drift" and slender seismic resisting systems of any type, compute the elastic deformations caused by the required forces and then multiply by the factor cd to determine the total deformations. Interstory drifts shall not exceed O.Ol33hsx' where hsx is the story height below level x. For purposes of this drift analysis only, it is permissible to use the computed funda­mental period <n of the building without the upper bound limi­tation specified in Section 2.4.3.2 when determining drift level seismic design forces. 
2.4.5 Demand on diaphragms. The deflection in the plane of the diaphragm shall not exceed the permissible deflection of the attached elements as determined by the evaluator. Permissi­ble deflection permits the attached element to maintain its structural integrity under the individual loading and continue to support the prescribed loads without endangering the occu­pants of the building. 
Floor and roof diaphragms shall be designed to resist a mini­mum force equal to 0.5Av times the weight of the diaphragm and other elements attached to the building plus the portion of the seismic shear force at that level, (V,), required to be trans­ferred to the components of the vertical seismic-resisting sys­tem because of offsets or changes in stiffness of the vertical components above and below the diaphragm. 
Diaphragms shall provide for both the shear and bending stresses resulting from these forces. Diaphragms shall have ties or struts to distribute the wall anchorage forces into the dia­phragm as prescribed in Section 3.6.4 ofthe 1994 NEHRP Rec­ommended Provisions. 
2.4.6 Demand on parts and portions of the building. Parts and portions ofstructures and permanent nonstructural compo­nents and equipment supported by a structure and their attach­ments, as identified in the building evaluation procedures, shall be evaluated to verify that they are capable of resisting the seismic forces specified below. All attachments or appendages, including anchorages and required bracing, shall be evaluated for seismic forces. Nomigid equipment, the structural failure of which would cause a life-safety hazard, also shall be evalu­ated. 
Each element or component evaluated shall be capable of resisting a total lateral seismic force, FP, where: 
FP=0.67(AvCcWc) (2-10) 

where: 
Av = 	the velocity-related acceleration coefficient given in Figures 2.1 and 2.1a. 
Cc = 	a coefficient given in Table 2.4.6. 
we = 	the weight of the element or component. 
The NPC of the building shall be determined using the pro­cedures in Article 11.

2.4.7 Quick checks of strength and stiffness. Evaluation statements may require quick check estimates of the strength and stiffness of the building. 
To check the average shear stress or drift for upper stories in addition to the first story, the story shear for an upper story may be approximated as follows: 



v. =(n+J)(w1 )1.2V 
(2-11)1 n+1 W 

where: 
j number of story level under consideration. n = total number of stories above ground level. v base shear from Equation 2-3. maximum story shear at story Level j.
VJ 
w = total seismic dead load. 
llj = 	total seismic dead load of all stories above Level j (see Section 2.4.1). 
2.4.7.1 Story drift for moment Frames. The following equa­tion for the drift ratio is applicable only to regular, multistory, multibay frames with columns continuous top and bottom: 
DR=(~b:;:)C:E)vccd (2-12) 

where: 
Cd = deflection amplification factor from Table 2.4.3.1. 

DR 
= drift ratio = interstory displacement divided by interstory height. E = modulus of elasticity (ksi). h = story height (in.). I = moment of inertia (in.'). kb IlL for the beam. kc = I/h for the column. L center-to-center length (in.). Vc = shear in the column (kips). 
For reinforced concrete frames, use appropriate cracked sec­tion properties pursuant to ACI 318-95 or later. For other con­figurations of frames, compute the drift ratio from the principles of structural mechanics. 
2.4.7.2 Shearing stress in concrete frame columns. The equation for a quick estimate of the average shearing stress, (vav), in the columns of concrete frames is as follows:
8
vavg = nc )(-V1 ) (2-13)
( 
Nc -nf Ac 
where: 

Ac 	summation of the cross-sectional area of all columns in the story under consideration. 
nc = 	total number of columns. 
nf = 	total number of frames in the direction of loading. 
Vj 	story shear from Equation 2-11. 
Equation 2-13 assumes that nearly all of the columns in the frame have similar stiffness. For other configurations of frames, compute the shear stress in the concrete columns from the principles of structural mechanics. 
2.4.7.3 Shearing stress in shear walls. The equation for a quick estimate of the average wall shear stress (vavg) is as fol­lows: 

(2-14) 
where: 

Aw = 	summation of the horizontal cross-sectional area of all shear walls in the direction of loading. The wall area shall be reduced by the area of any openings. For masonry walls, use the net area. For wood-framed walls, use the length rather than the area. 
Vj = 	story shear at the level under consideration determined from Equation 2-11. 
The allowable stresses for the various types of shear wall building are given in Section 5.1 for concrete shear walls, Sec­
2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE 

tion 5.3 for reinforced masonry shear walls, Section 5.4 for unreinforced masonry shear walls and Section 5.6 for wood shear walls. 
2.4.7.4 Diagonal bracing. The equation for a quick estimate of the average axial stress in the diagonal bracing (jb) is as fol­lows: 
f -_J_ ____!!!__ (2-15)
( V. )(L )
br -sNb,. Ab,. 

where: 
Ab,. = the average area of a diagonal brace (in. 2). 
Lb,. = average length of the braces (ft). 
Nbr = number of braces in tension and compression if the braces are designed for compression; if not, use the number of braces in tension, if the braces are not designed for compression. 
s = average span length of braced spans (ft). 
Vj = maximum story shear at each level (kips). 
2.4.8 Procedure for evaluating unreinforced masonry bear­ing wall buildings. Unreinforced masonry bearing wall build­ings shall automatically be placed in SPC 1. 
2.4.9 Element capacities. Calculate element capacities on the ultimate-strength basis of the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions. 
When calculating capacities of deteriorated or damaged ele­ments, the evaluator shall make appropriate reductions in the material strength, the section properties and any other aspects of the capacity affected by the deterioration. 
2.4.9.1 Wood. The basic document is Chapter 9 of the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions, as modified in Section 5.6 of these regulations. 
2.4.9.2 Steel. The basic document is Chapter 5 of the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions, as modified in Articles 4 and 6 of these regulations. 
2.4.9.3 Concrete. The basic document is ACI 318-89. Because this document is on an ultimate-strength basis, the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions specifies special load fac­tors that include the factor of 1.0 for earthquake effects (see Equations 2-1 and 2-2). 
2.4.9.4 Masonry. The basic document is Chapter 8 of the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions, as modified in Article 5 of these regulations. 
2.4.10 Dynamic analysis. Unless otherwise noted, the proce­dures given in Articles 3 through 10 use the equivalent lateral force procedure. The use of a dynamic analysis procedure is required for the following: 
1) Buildings 240 feet or more in height; 
2) Buildings wilh vcrlical irregularities caused by signifi­cant mass or geometric irregularities; 

SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS 
3) Buildings where the distribution of the lateral forces departs from that assumed in the equivalent lateral force procedure; and 
4) Where required by the evaluation statements in Articles 3 through 10. 
Dynamic analysis procedures shall conform to the criteria established in this section. The analysis shall be based on an appropriate ground motion representation as specified in this section and shall be performed using accepted principles of dynamics. Structures that are evaluated in accordance with this section shall comply with all other applicable requirements. 
2.4.10.1 Ground motion. The ground motion representation shall be an elastic response spectra developed for mean values for the specific site, in accordance with the procedures in Title 24, Section 1629A.2 of 1995 California Building Code (CBC) or equivalent provision in later version of the CBC. 
2.4.10.2 Mathematical model. A mathematical model of the physical structure shall represent the spatial distribution of the mass and stiffness ofthe structure to calculate the significant fea­tures of its dynamic response. A three-dimensional model shall be used when the dynamic analysis involves a structure with an irregular plan configuration and rigid or semirigid diaphragms. 
2.4.10.3 Analysis procedure. 
2.4.10.3.1 Response spectrum analysis. An elastic dynamic analysis of a structure shall use the peak dynamic response of all modes having a significant contribution to total structural response. This requirement may be satisfied by demonstrating that for the modes considered, at least 90% of the participating mass of the structure is included in the calculation of response in each principal horizontal direction. Peak modal responses are calculated using the ordinates of the appropriate response spectrum curve that corresponds to the modal periods. Maxi­mum modal contributions shall be combined in a statistical manner using recognized combination methods to obtain an approximate total structural response. 
2.4.10.3.2 Scaling of results. When the base shear for a given direction is less than that required by the equivalent lateral force procedure, the base shear shall be increased to the value prescribed in that procedure. All corresponding response parameters, including deflections, member forces and moments, shall be increased proportionately. 
When the base shear for a given direction is greater than that required by the equivalent lateral force procedure, the base shear may be decreased to the value prescribed in that proce­dure. All corresponding response parameters, including deflections, member forces, and moments, may be decreased proportionately. 
2.4.10.3.3 Post-yield analyses. Post-yield analyses of a sim­plified model of the building may be made to estimate the non­linear displacements of the structural system. If the analyses is made with a two-dimensional planar model, the additive tor­sional displacement shall be established through methods that are equivalent to those used for response spectra analyses. 
The displacements or rotations of structural members esti­mated by the post-yield analysis shall be compared with rele­vant experimental data to determine the adequacy of the member or system. 
2.4.10.4 Torsion. The analysis shall account for torsional effects, including accidental torsional effects, as prescribed in Section 2.4.3.9. Where three-dimensional models are used for analysis, effects of accidental torsion shall be accounted for by appropriate adjustments in the model such as adjustment of mass locations or by equivalent static procedures such as pro­vided in Section 2.4.3.9. 
2.4.11 Acceptance criteria. The elements to be analyzed are specified in the procedures given in Articles 3 through 10. The total demand, Q, is calculated by Equation 2-1 or 2-2 as modi­fied below. The capacity, C, is calculated according to the pro­cedures of Section 2.4.9. The basic acceptance criterion is: 
Q:::;;c 	(2-17) 

Where elements or portions of a lateral force resisting sys­tem are expected to behave in a less ductile manner than the system as a whole, the term QE in Equation 2-1 or 2-2 shall be modified or special calculations be made to account for the dif­ferent failure modes of the various elements. Modification of QE, and special calculation procedures and when they shall be used, are described in Articles 3 through 8. 
If all significant elements meet the basic acceptance criteria as specified herein, no further analysis is needed. 
2.4.12 Assessment of element deficiencies. The result of the checks specified in Articles 3 through 10 will show whether or not the elements meet the requirements of the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions as modified herein. 
For those elements not meeting the specified acceptance cri­teria, the relative hazard or seriousness of the deficiencies shall be assessed. Deficiencies shall be ranked according to: 
1) Degrees of "overstress" (both total and seismic); 
2) Element importance in the load path; and 
3) Building, ductile and element stability. 
2.5 Final evaluation. 
2.5.1 Review the statements and responses. Upon comple­tion of the analysis and field work, the evaluator shall review the evaluation statements and the responses to the statements to ensure that all of the concerns have been addressed. 
2.5.2 Assemble and review the results of the procedures. Upon completion of the procedures given in Articles 3 through 10, the evaluator shall assemble and review the results. 
2.5.2.1 Q versus C. The criterion Q C is an indication of whether an element meets the requirements of the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions as modified for these regu­lations. However, because Q involves gravity effects, the ratio of Qto C for an element must be considered in light of the seis­mic demand versus capacity in order to fully determine the seriousness of the earthquake hazard. 
2.5.2.2 DE /CE ratios. The severity of the deficiencies shall be assessed by listing the DE ICE ratios in descending order. The element with the largest value is the weakest link in the build­ing. If the element can fail without jeopardizing the building, then the SPC may be based upon the element with the next lower ratio, and so on. Failure ofan element will not jeopardize the building provided an alternate load path (neglecting the failed element) exists, and the vertical and lateral stability of the structure, or portions of the structure, is not impaired. The presence of an element with a DEICE greater than one, where failure of that element will jeopardize the stability of the build­ing or element, requires that nonconforming buildings be placed in SPC 1. For conforming buildings, see the appropriate evaluation statement. 
2.5.2.3 Qualitative issues. Some of the procedures identify specific deficiencies without any calculation. These deficien­cies will automatically place buildings in SPC 1, 3 or 4. 
2.5.3 Final evaluation. The final evaluation will place the building in the appropriate the SPC (Table 2.5.3), based on a review of the qualitative and quantitative results of the proce­dures and the list of deficiencies. In general, an unmitigated "false" answer to an evaluation statement will lower the SPC of the Building. A "false" evaluation statement may be consid­ered mitigated if the building, element or component is justi­fied using the procedure outlined in the evaluation statement, or the effects of the condition are incorporated in the overall evaluation, as described in Section 2.5.2.2. Alternatively, the SPC rating of a building may be assigned by the Office on the basis of a collapse probability assessment performed in accor­dance with Section 1.4.5.1.2. 
2.5.3.1 Conforming buildings. Conforming buildings, other than those of welded steel moment frame construction (Build­ing Type 3 and possibly Building Types 4 and 6, if a dual sys­tem is present), without any unmitigated "false" evaluation statements shall be placed in SPC 5. Other conforming build­ings shall be placed in the lowest SPC directed by the evalua­tion statements. 
2.5.3.2 Nonconforming buildings. An unmitigated "False" answer to any evaluation statement shall result in nonconforming buildings being placed in SPC 1, unless directed otherwise by the procedures for that particular evaluation statement. All other nonconforming buildings shall be placed in SPC 2. 
2.6 The final report. The report shall include the following elements: 
1. 	
A description of the building, including photographs, and sketches of the lateral-force-resisting system using an OSHPD approved format; 

2. 	
The set ofstatements from the Appendix, with a synopsis of the investigation and supporting calculations that were made;

ARTICLE 3 
PROCEDURES FOR BUILDING SYSTEMS 


3.0 Introduction. This article sets forth general requirements that apply to all buildings: load path, redundancy, configura­tion, adjacent buildings and the condition of the materials. 
3.1 Load path. The structure contains a complete load path for seismic force effects from any horizontal direction that serves to transfer the inertial forces from the mass to the foundation. For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this con­dition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The load path is the most essential requirement for a building. There must be a lateral-force-resisting system that forms a load path between the foundation and all diaphragm levels and that ties all of the portions of the building together. The load path must be complete and sufficiently strong. 
3.2 Redundancy. The structure will remain laterally stable after the failure of any single element. 
Check whether stability of the structure depends on a single element. Ifthe failure of a single element (member or connec­tion) will result in loss of lateral stability, the element shall be checked for adequacy using an amplification factor of Ci2, but not less than 1.5. P-delta effects shall be included in this check. 
3.3 Configuration. Vertical irregularities are defined in terms of discontinuities of strength, stiffness, geometry and mass. 
Horizontal irregularities involve the horizontal distribution oflateral forces to the resisting frames or shear walls. Irregular­ities in the shape of the diaphragm itself (i.e., diaphragms that are L-shaped or have notches) are covered in Article 7. 
3.3.1 Weak story. Visual observation or a Quick Check indi­cates lhallhere are no significant strength discontinuities in any of the vertical elements in the lateral-force-resisting system; the story strength at any story is not less than 80 percent of the strength of the story above. 
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check story strengths individually. Where a weak story exists, the resisting elements shall be checked; include P-delta effects and inelastic demand. To compensate for the concentration ofinelastic action where the story strength of the weak story is less than 65 percent of the story above, amplify the design forces in the weak story by the factor cd /2, but not less than 1.5. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4. 
3.3.2 Soft story. Visual observation or a Quick Check indicates that there are no significant stiffness discontinuities in any of the vertical elements in the lateral-force-resisting system; the lateral stiffness of a story is not less than 70 percent of that in the story above or less than 80 percent of the average stiffness of the three stories above. 
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the stiffness of certain portions of the building. Where a soft story condition is indicated, the stiffness of the building shall be calculated story by story, in order to determine whether a story falls within the definition of a soft story. Where a soft story exists, the resisting elements shall be checked; include P-delta effects. For buildings more than 65 feet or five stories tall, a dynamic analysis shall be per­formed to compute the distribution of seismic forces. 
3.3.3 Geometry. There are no significant geometrical irregu­larities; there are no setbacks (i.e., no changes in horizontal dimension of the lateral-force-resisting system of more than 30 percent in a story relative to the adjacent stories). 
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may con­sider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are neces­sary. Where geometric irregularities exist, a dynamic analysis shall be performed to compute the vertical distribution of seis­mic forces. 
3.3.4 Mass. There are no significant mass irregularities; there is no change ofeffective mass of more than 50 percent from one story to the next, excluding light roofs. 
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the distribution of mass in the building. The effective mass is the real mass consisting of the dead weight of the floor plus the actual weights of partitions and equipment. Where mass irregularities exist, a dynamic analysis shall be performed to compute the vertical distribution of seismic forces. 
3.3.5 Vertical discontinuities. All shear walls, infilled walls and frames are continuous to the foundation. 
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The primary deficiency is in the strength of the col­umns that support the wall or frame. The secondary deficiency is in the strength of the connecting strut or diaphragm. Con­forming buildings which fail these checks shall be placed in SPC4. 
Procedure for columns: Check the columns that support the upper verticallateralload-resisting element for their capacity to support the gravity loads plus the overturning forces. The overturning forces shall be based on the design forces ampli­fied by the factor C"/2, but not less than 1.5, or on the capacity of the vertical lateral load-resisting element to resist lateral force if this is greater. The column check shall include P-delta effects. 
Procedure for strut or diaphragm: Check the strut or dia­phragm for its ability to transfer the load from the discontinu­ous element to the lower resisting element. 
3.3.6 Torsion. The lateral-force-resisting elements form a well-balanced system that is not subject to significant torsion. Significant torsion will be taken as any condition where the dis­tance between the story center ofrigidity and the story center of mass is greater than 20 percent of the width of the structure in either major plan dimension. 
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. One deficiency is in the layout and the strengths and stiffness of the walls and frames of the lateral-force-resisting system. Another deficiency is in the strength of columns that are not part of the lateral-force-resisting system but are forced to undergo displacements due to the rotation of the diaphragm. Verify the adequacy of the system by analyzing the torsional response using procedures that are appropriate for the relative rigidities of the diaphragms and the vertical resisting elements. Calculate the maximum story drift (the average building drift plus the additional displacement due to torsion). Verify that all vertical load-carrying elements can maintain their load-carry­ing ability under the expected drifts. When checking columns, include P-delta effects and consider inelastic demand. Con­forming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 
4. 

3.4 Adjacent buildings. There is no immediately adjacent structure that is less than half as tall or has floors/levels that do not match those of the building being evaluated. A neighboring structure is considered to be "immediately adjacent" if it is within 2 inches times the number of stories away from the building being evaluated. 
The deficiency is the distance between the buildings. Report the condition as a hazard. Where both buildings are designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated. Other conforming buildings which fail these checks shall be placed in SPC 4. 
3.5 Deflection incompatibility. Column and beam assemblies that are not part of the lateral-force-resisting system (i.e., grav­ity load-resisting frames) are capable of accommodating imposed building drifts, including amplified drift caused by diaphragm deflections, without loss of vertical load-carrying capacity. 
2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE 

For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the ductility of the vertical load-carrying sys­tem. Calculate the expected drifts using the procedures in Sec­tion 2.4.4. Use net section properties for all reinforced concrete elements in the lateral-force-resisting system. Include the lat­eral displacements due to diaphragm deflections, using the dia­phragm loading computed in Section 2.4.6. Evaluate the capacity of the nonlateral-force-resisting columns and beam assemblies to undergo the combined drift, considering moment-axial force interaction and column shear. 
3.6 Short "captive" columns. There are no columns with height-to-depth ratios less than 75 percent of the nominal height-to-depth ratios of the typical columns at that level. 
The deficiency is in the tendency of short captive columns to attract high shear forces because of their high stiffness relative to adjacent elements. Calculate the story drift, and determine the shear demand (Ve) in the short column caused by the drift (Ve =2MIL). The ratio of VJV" shall be less than one, where V~ is the column nominal shear capacity computed in accordance with ACI criteria. Conforming buildings which fail these checks shall be placed in SPC 4. 


3.7 Evaluation of materials and conditions. 
3.7.1 Deterioration of wood. None of the wood members shows signs of decay, shrinkage, splitting, fire damage or sag­ging, and none of the metal accessories is deteriorated, broken or loose. 
The deficiency is in the capacity of the deteriorated ele­ments. Determine the cause and extent of damage. Identify the lateral-force-resisting system and determine the consequences of the damage to the system. The system shall be judged ade­quate if it can perform with the damaged elements. Check the structural systems with appropriate reductions in member properties. 
3.7.2 Overdriven nails. There is no evidence of overdriven nails in the shear walls or diaphragms. 
The deficiency is in the capacity of the fasteners. Check the wall demand and capacity, using reduced strength due to overdriven fasteners. 
3.7.3 Deterioration of steel. There is no significant visible rusting, corrosion or other deterioration in any of the steel ele­ments in the vertical-or lateral-force-resisting systems.

SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS 
The deficiency is the reduced area of the prestress strands and, with coil anchors, the ability of the anchorage to maintain its grip under cyclic loading. Inspect a sample of the concrete in the area of the anchorage to determine its condition. Determine the cause and extent ofthe deterioration. Consider the effects of anchorage failure on the vertical and lateral load-carrying capacity of the structure. 
3.7.6 Concrete wall cracks. All diagonal cracks in the wall elements are 1.0 mm or less in width, are in isolated locations and do not form an X pattern. 
The deficiency is the reduced capacity of the wall. Deter­mine the cause and extent of the cracking. Check the structural systems with reduced wall capacity. 
3.7. 7 Cracks in boundary columns. There are no diagonal cracks wider than 1.0 mm in concrete columns that encase the masonry infills. 
The deficiency is the reduced capacity of the wall. Evaluate the wall with limited capacity assigned to the deteriorated ele­ments. Determine the cause and extent of the damage. 
3.7.8 Precast concrete walls. There is no significant visible deterioration ofconcrete or reinforcing steel or evidence ofdis­tress, especially at the connections.

3.7.9 Masonry joints. The mortar cannot be easily scraped away from the joints by hand with a metal tool, and there are no significant areas of eroded mortar. 
The deficiency is in the strength of the wall. Check the ade­quacy of the walls with the strength determined by tests. This evaluation statement also applies to masonry veneers present on the exterior or interior walls of the building. 
3.7.10 Masonry units. There is no visible deterioration of large areas of masonry units. 
The deficiency is in the strength of the units. Determine the cause and extent of deterioration and use reduced capacity in determining the adequacy of the units. 
3.7.11 Cracks in infill walls. There are no diagonal cracks in the infilled walls that extend throughout a panel or are greater than 1.0 mm wide. 
The deficiency is the reduced capacity of the wall. Deter­mine the cause and extent of the cracking. Ifappropriate, check the structural systems with reduced wall capacity.

PROCEDURES FOR 
MOMENT-RESISTING SYSTEMS 


4.0 Introduction. Moment frames develop their resistance to lateral forces through the flexural strength and continuity of beam and column elements. Moment frames may be classified as special, intermediate and ordinary frames. 
For evaluations using these regulations, it is not necessary to determine the type of frame in the building. The issues are addressed by appropriate acceptance criteria in the specified procedures. For determination of element capacities, see Arti­cle 2, Section 2.4.9. 
4.1 Frames with infill walls. 
4.1.1 Interfering walls. All infill walls placed in moment frames are isolated from structural elements. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is an inappropriate connection of the wall to the frame. Evaluate the relative strength and stiffness of the walls and frames, considering the nature and size of the joint or con­nection between the wall and the frame. If the strength of the walls is not commensurate with the stiffness, the building should be treated as Type 7 or Type 10 (Article 2, Section 2.2.3 "Common Building Types"), a frame with infill walls. If the infill walls do not extend the full story height and are not prop­erly isolated from the frame columns, evaluate the column shear demand and capacity, based on a column height equal to the clear distance from the top of the wall to the bottom of the slab or beam above, amplifying the design forces in the short column by Cj2, but not less than 1.5. The shear demand need not exceed the shear capacity conesponding to flexural capac­ity of the column, based on a column height equal to the clear distance from the top of the wall to the bottom of the slab or beam above. 
4.2 Steel moment frames. Welded steel moment frames may be subject to detailed frame joint evaluation requirements, as outlined in this section. The purpose of this joint evaluation is to determine if the building has experienced joint damage in strong ground shaking. 
4.2.0.1 Preliminary screening. All welded steel moment frame structures shall undergo a detailed frame joint evaluation if the building is located at a site that has experienced the fol­lowing: 
1. 	
An earthquake of magnitude greater than or equal to 6.5 that produced ground motion in excess of 0.20 g; or 

2. 	
An earthquake that generated ground motion in excess of 


0.30 g. 
The ground motion estimates shall be based on actual instru­mental recordings in the vicinity of the building. When such ground motion records are not available, ground motion esti­mates may be based on empirical or analytical techniques. All ground motion estimates shall reflect the site-specific soil con­ditions. 
4.2.0.2 Additional indicators. A detailed frame joint evalua­tion of the building shall be performed if any of the following apply: 
1. 	
Significant structural damage is observed in one or more welded steel moment frame structures located within 1 km of the building on sites with similar, or more firm, soil properties; 

2. 	
An earthquake having a magnitude of 6.5 or greater, where the structure is located within 5 km of the trace ofa surface rupture or within the vertical projection of the rupture area when no surface rupture has occuned; 

3. 	
Significant architectural or structural damage has been observed in the building following an earthquake; or 


4. 	Entry to the building has been limited by the building official because of earthquake damage, regardless of the type or nature of the damage. 
4.2.0.3 Connection inspections. Detailed frame joint evalua­tions shall be performed in accordance with the procedures in the Interim Guidelines: Evaluation, Repair, Modification and Design ofWelded Steel Moment Frame Structures, FEMA 267, August 1995. 
4.2.1 Drift check. The building satisfies the Quick Check of the frame drift. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check drift using the procedures in Section 2.4.7.1 against the prescribed limit. If the drift exceeds the limiting drift at any story level, the structure shall be evaluated with full-frame analysis using the anticipated distribution of lateral forces to the moment-resisting frames and including P-delta effects. Check the other statements using the demand from this analy­sis. 
4.2.2 Compact members. All moment-frame elements meet the compact section requirements of the basic AISC documents. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the member capacities. Check member capaci­ties, using member demands obtained from a frame analysis. Calculate member capacities using appropriate criteria for noncompact sections. Check the member capacities using appropriate R values (e.g., noncompact members require use of the R value for ordinary frames). 
4.2.3 Beam penetrations. All openings in frame-beam webs have a depth less than one-fourth of the beam depth and are located in the center half of the beams. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the shear capacity of the beam. Check that the shear capacity of the beam is sufficient to develop the flexural plastic hinge. Ifthe shear capacity is insufficient to develop the flexural capacity of the member, use the R value for ordinary frames. 
4.2.4 Moment connections. All beam-column connections in the lateral-force-resisting moment frame have full-penetration flange welds and a bolted or welded web connection. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the connection. Check the con­nection on the basis of its strength. Check the member capaci­ties using appropriate R values. Connections that do not develop the flexural capacity of the member require use of the R value for ordinary frames. 
4.2.5 Column splices. All column splice details of the moment-resisting frames include connection of both flanges and the web. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the bolts or welds in the connec­
2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE 

tion. Check the adequacy of the splice connection for all grav­ity and seismic loads. Amplify the seismic load for partial-penetration welded splices by the factor cd /2. 
4.2.6 Joint webs. All web thicknesses within joints of moment-resisting frames meet AISC criteria for web shear. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the web. Calculate the joint shear capacity using formulas given in the AISC provisions and com­pare it to the demand from an equivalent lateral force analysis or the average column shear, Vc, calculated for the Quick Check for drift. 
4.2.7 Girder flange continuity plates. There are girder flange continuity plates at joints. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the joint. Check joints without such plates using AISC provisions, using the R value for ordi­nary frames. 
4.2.8 Strong column/weak beam. At least one half of the joints in each story are strong column/weak beam (33 percent on every line of moment frame). Roof joints need not be considered. 
The deficiency is excessive ductility demand and displace­ment in a single story. Compare beam and column moment capacities, including the effect of axial force. The evaluator may consider this condition mitigated if the joints in the build­ing meet the provisions of Section 271 O(g)5 of the 1992 edition of Part 2, Title 24. Conforming buildings which do not meet those provisions shall be placed in SPC 4. 
4.2.9 Out-of-plane bracing. Beam-column joints are braced out-of-plane. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the stability of the beam-column joint. Verify the joint bracing by visual observation. 
4.2.10 Pre-Northridge earthquake welded moment frame joints. Welded steel moment frame beam-column joints are designed and constructed in accordance with recommenda­tions in FEMA 267, Interim Guidelines: Evaluation, Repair, Modification and Design of Welded Steel Moment Frame Structures, August 1995. 
For buildings constructed under permit issued after October 25, 1994, the evaluator may consider this condition as miti­gated. The deficiency is in the ductility of the beam-column joint. The following procedures shall be used for categorizing buildings with welded steel moment frame joints: 
Procedure for conforming buildings: Conforming build­ings located in Seismic Zone 4 of 1995 California Building Code (CBC) or later version of the CBC, within a zone desig­nated as being potentially subject to near field effects in strong ground shaking, shall be placed in SPC 3. 
All other conforming buildings shall be placed in SPC 4. 

SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS 
Procedure for nonconforming buildings: Nonconforming buildings shall be placed in SPC 2. 
4.3 Concrete moment frames. The details covered in evalua­tion statements in Sections 4.3.4 through 4.3.14 will be found in frames that have been designed and detailed for ductile behavior. Ifany one detail is not present, the frames are not con­sidered to meet life-safety goals, and nonconforming buildings shall be placed in SPC 1. For conforming buildings, see the appropriate evaluation statement. For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the building may assume "true" responses to all evaluation statements in this section. 
4.3.1 Shearing stress check. The building satisfies the Quick Check of the average shearing stress in the columns. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Per­form a quick estimation of the average shearing stress in the columns according to the procedure specified in Section 
2.4.7.2. Ifthe average column shear stress is greater than 60 psi, a more detailed evaluation of the structure shall be performed. This evaluation shall employ a more accurate estimation of the level and distribution of the lateral loads; use the procedures outlined in Section 2.4. 
4.3.2 Drift check. The building satisfies the Quick Check of story drift. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check drift using the procedures in Section 2.4.7 .1 against the prescribed limit. If the drift exceeds the limiting drift at any story level, the structure shall be evaluated with full-frame analysis using the anticipated distribution of lateral forces to the moment-resisting frames and including P-delta effects as found in Section 2.4.1. Check the other statements using the demand from this analysis. 
4.3.3 Prestressed frame elements. The lateral-load-resisting frames do not include any prestressed or post-tensioned elements. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the frames during inelastic straining. Check the capacity of the members and joints using all of the mild steel reinforcing that is available and bonded prestressing when appropriate. The R value used for evaluation shall reflect the ductility and damping of the system. Where better information is not available, multiply the R value selected on the basis of mild reinforcement by 0.75 to account for the effect of prestressing. 
4.3.4 Joint eccentricity. There are no eccentricities larger than 20 percent of the smallest column plan dimension between girder and column centerlines. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the frame, either the members or the joints or both. Evaluate the frarnL:s considering the addi tional shear stresses caused by the joint torsion. 
4.3.5 No shear failures. The shear capacity of frame members is greater than the moment capacity. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is inadequate shear capacity in the columns or beams. Compare Ve with the member shear capacity, <!> V,,, calculated in accordance with ACI 318 Appendix. The ratio Ve I V" shall be less than or equal to 1.0. 
4.3.6 Strong column/weak beam. The moment capacity ofthe columns is greater than that of the beams. 
The deficiency is in column capacity. Compare the sum of the beam moment capacities to that of the column capacities. Include the pmticipation of the slab in the beam capacities. The moment capacity to be compared is the plastic moment, Mp,.· The ratio ofthe sum ofthe MP,. for the columns to the sum ofthe Mpr for the beams is required to be not less than 1.2. Conforming build­ings which do not meet this criteria shall be placed in SPC 4. 
4.3.7 Stirrup and tie hooks. The beam stirrups and column ties are anchored into the member cores with hooks of 135 degrees or more. 
The deficiency is in the shear resistance and confinement of the member. Determine if beam stirrups and column ties are appropriately anchored into member cores with hooks of 135 degrees or more. Conforming buildings which do not meet this criteria shall be placed in SPC 4. 
4.3.8 Column-tie spacing. Frame columns have ties spaced at d/4 or less throughout their length and at 8 db, or less at all potential plastic hinge regions. 
The deficiency is in the shear capacity of the column. Report this condition as a deficiency. Conforming buildings which do not meet this criteria shall be placed in SPC 4. 
4.3.9 Column-bar splices. All column bar lap splice lengths are greater than 35 db, long and are enclosed by ties spaced at 8 db, or less. 
The deficiency is in the strength and ductility of the column. Compm·e the splice length provided with that required by Sec­tions 12.2 and 12.15 of the ACI 318 provisions. Conforming buildings which do not meet this criteria shall be placed in SPC 
4. 
4.3.10 Beam bars. At least two longitudinal top and two longi­tudinal bottom bars extend continuously throughout the length ofeach frame beam. At least 25 percent of the steel provided at the joints for either positive or negative moment is continuous throughout the members. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength and ductility of the beam. Deter­mine if the required beam bars are present. For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as miti­gated, and no calculations are necessary. 
4.3.11 Beam-bar splices. The lap splices for longitudinal beam reinforcing are located within the center half of the mem­ber lengths and not in the vicinity of potential plastic hinges. 
The deficiency is in the strength and ductility of the beam. Determine if the beam bar splices are detailed and located such that the yield capacity of the beam can be developed. Conform­ing buildings which do not meet this criteria shall be placed in SPC4. 
4.3.12 Stirrup spacing. All beams have stirrups spaced at d/2 or less throughout their length and at 8 db, or less at potential hinge locations. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength and ductility of the beam. Deter­mine if the stirrups meet the specified spacing requirements, such that the yield capacity of the beam can be developed. 
4.3.13 Beam truss bars. Bent-up longitudinal steel is not used for shear reinforcement. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength and ductility of the beam. Deter­mine if bent-up shear reinforcement is present. If present, check the shear capacity of the element ignoring the effects of the bent-up longitudinal bars. 
4.3.14 Joint reinforcing. Column ties extend at their typical spacing through all beam-column joints at exterior columns. 
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength and ductility of the beam-column joint. Calculate the joint capacity, Ve, and the joint shear, ~· The joint shear is calculated at a horizontal sec­tion at mid-height of the joint. The horizontal shear at the criti­cal section is obtained from summation ofhorizontal forces in a free-body diagram of the upper half of the joint as ~=(T1+T,) -Ve where T1 and T, the forces in the flexural tensile reinforce­ment in the beams on the left and right sides of the joint, respec­tively, are calculated assuming a steel stress equal to 1.25 fy. See Figure 4.3.14 for computation of Ve. The ratio ~/Ve shall be less than or equal to 1. Conforming buildings which do not meet this criteria shall be placed in SPC 4.

4.3.15 Flat slab frames. The system is not a frame consisting of columns and a flat slab/plate without beams. 
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Perform a detailed analysis, or assign the building to SPC 1. 
4.4 Precast concrete moment frames. 
4.4.1 Precast frames. The lateral loads are not resisted by pre­cast concrete frame elements. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the connections. Check the ade­quacy of the precast frames. Where lateral movement will cause strength capacities to be first exceeded at connections, use R = Cd = 1.5 unless there is information on connection behavior that justifies higher values. Where all yielding occurs within members, use the R-value for the appropriate cast­in-place frame. 
4.4.2 Precast connections. For buildings with concrete shear walls, the connection between precast frame elements such as chords, ties and collectors in the lateral-force-resisting system can develop the capacity of the connected members. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the connections. Analyze the connections. Determine where connection failures would be brittle (e.g., pull-out of an embedded item would occur before yield of a mild steel element). Analyze structure for stability assuming that these brittle connections have failed or are not capable of transmitting forces, or check such connections for seismic force amplified by factor cd 12, but not less than 1.5. For shear capacity, refer to Section 4.3. For flexure, find the path offorces from the element through the connection into the other element. 
4.5 Frames not part of the lateral-force-resisting system. This section deals with frames that were not designed to be part of the lateral-force-resisting system. These are basic structural frames of steel or concrete that are designed for gravity loads with shear walls, bracing or moment frames providing the resistance to lateral forces. 
Ifthe primary lateral-force-resisting system consists of con­crete walls (infilled in steel frames or monolithic in concrete frames), the building shall be treated as a concrete shear wall building (Type 6) with the frame columns as boundary ele­ments. If the walls are masonry infills, the frames shall be treated as steel or concrete frames with infill walls of masonry (Type 7 or 10). Buildings with steel braces shall be treated as braced frame systems (Type 4). The principal deficiency iden­tified in this section is loss of vertical-load-carrying capacity due to excessive deformations. 
The analysis must include the deformations imposed by the infill walls, and the consequences ofthe failure ofsuch walls. 
4.5.1 Complete frames. The steel or concrete frames form a complete vertical load-carrying system. 
SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check the shear walls or braced frames, including the effects of all dead and live loads, and note that the R values for buildings without a complete vertical load-carrying space frame are dif­ferent from those for complete frame buildings. For wall sys­tems, the frame is considered incomplete ifthe beams end at the edge of a shear wall that has no boundary columns or, if there are such columns, the beams do not continue across in the plane of the wall. For chevron-braced frame systems, the frame is considered incomplete if the beam in the brace frame cannot carry the design dead and live loads without the presence ofthe braces. 
ARTICLE 5 
PROCEDURES FOR SHEAR WALLS 


5.0 Introduction. Shear walls have two aspects: carrying in-plane shear when the earthquake direction under consider­ation is parallel to the wall and resisting out-of-plane forces when the earthquake direction under consideration is perpen­dicular to the wall. The in-plane effects are covered in this arti­cle. Out-of-plane effects are covered in Article 8. All walls not structurally isolated are assumed to act as shear walls that will participate in resisting lateral forces up to their capacity. 
5.1 Concrete shear walls. 
5.1.1 Shearing stress check. The building satisfies the Quick Check of the shearing stress in the shear walls. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Gen­erate the lateral loads using the Quick Check procedure of Sec­tion 2.4.7.3. lfvavg is greater than 50 psi (or square root off)ffc is known), a more detailed evaluation of the structure shall be performed. This evaluation shall employ a more accurate esti­mation of the level and distribution of the lateral loads, using the analysis procedures in Article 2. 
5.1.2 Overturning. All shear walls have hw!lw ratios less than 4 to 1. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the required resistance to overturning moments. Calculate the resistance to the required overturning moments. The overturning resistance shall include the resis­tance contributed by wall flanges, friction on piling, earth over foundations, and floor and roof weights supported by the wall. The calculated resistance shall be greater than 0.75 times the base moment of the shear wall. The overturning resistance moment may be taken as the righting moment about an edge of the footing or the wall flexural capacity, whichever is less. 
5.1.3 Coupling beams. The stirrups in all coupling beams are spaced at d/2 or less and are anchored into the core with hooks of 135 degrees or more. 
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with lhe 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the coupling beams. Assume that the beams yield. Calculate their end-moment capacity based either on flexural yield or shear capacity, whichever is lower. The coupling beam moment capacity should include the contribution of a reasonable por­tion of the adjacent floor slab reinforcement when this rein­forcement is in tension. Analyze the walls as independent walls with these restoring moments or shears helping to stabilize the walls. Check the stability of the wall and the stresses in the ver­tical boundaries. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4, and no calculations are necessary. 
5.1.4 Column splices. Steel column splice details in shear wall boundary elements can develop the tensile strength of the column. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the splice in the boundary col­umn. Determine the maximum tensile column load in each case and verify the adequacy of the splice to resist this load, includ­ing gravity loads. Check the adequacy of the splice connection for all gravity and seismic loads. Amplify the seismic load for partial-penetration welded splices by the factor cd /2, but not less than 1.5, when the seismic load produces tension at the splice. 
5.1.5 Wall connections. There is positive connection between the shear walls and the steel beams and columns. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the adequacy of the connections between the shear wall and the beams and columns that are its boundary ele­ments. Calculate the efiective overturning demand for the walls and check the adequacy of the shear transfer to the steel ele­ments. A value for shear friction between steel and concrete shall be included only if the steel element is completely encased with reinforced concrete. 
5.1.6 Confinement reinforcing. For shear walls with hw !lw greater than 2.0, the boundary elements are confined with spi­rals or ties with spacing less then 8db. 
For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the ductility of the vertical boundary elements that are required to resist large axial forces. Check the need for boundary elements, per ACI 318. Where boundary elements are required but not provided, amplify the seismic forces for the entire structure by the factor 1.25 (and use 0.8Cd for drift calculation). Conforming buildings which fail this evaluation statement shall be placed in SPC 4, and no calculations are necessary. 
5.1.7 Reinforcing steel. The total reinforcing steel for concrete walls is greater than 0.0025 times the gross area of the wall along both the longitudinal and transverse axes and the maxi­mum spacing of reinforcing steel is 18 inches. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the quantity of reinforcing in the wall. Calcu­late the capacity of the walls with the reinforcing that is pro­vided, but amplify the seismic forces by the factor 1.25 (and use 0.8C" for drift calculation). Where the reinforcing in the wall is less than 0.0015 times the gross area of the wall along the longitudinal or transverse axis, or if the reinforcing steel spacing exceeds 18 inches, the contribution of the wall to lat­eral strength and stiffness of the building shall be ignored and, if it is a bearing wall, the building shall be placed in SPC 1. 
5.1.8 Reinforcing at openings. There is special wall reinforce­ment around all openings. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the reinforcing in the piers and spandrels. Determine the capacity of the spandrels and piers considering all available reinforcing steel that crosses the critical sections. 
5.2 Precast concrete shear walls. Shear walls of precast con­crete are in segments that are tied together, but the connections may be of a brittle type. Connections adequate for design level forces may not be capable of developing the yield level capac­ity of the panels. The effects of the precast panel connections on the other evaluation statements concerned with wall ele­ments shall be considered. The deficiency is in the quality and ductility of the connections. 
5.2.1 Panel-to-panel connections. Adjacent wall panels are not connected by welded steel inserts. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the inserts. Check the welded inserts. Determine where connection failures would be brittle (e.g., pull-out of an embedded i tern would occur before yield of a mild steel element). Analyze structure for stability assuming that these brittle connections have failed or are not capable of transmitting forces or check such connections for seismic force amplified by the factor Cd/2, but not less than 1.5. 
5.2.2 Wall openings. Openings constitute less than 75 percent of the length of any perimeter wall with the wall piers having hw llw ratios of less than 2.0. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency may be in the strength of the panel connections or may be that the reinforced concrete elements actually behave like a moment frame and should be evaluated as such. Check the elements in the precast shear wall system. When large open areas exist, check the transfer ofshear between the diaphragm and the wall. Compare the lateral displacements of the wall due to shear and flexure. Ifmore than 50 percent of the total lateral dis­placement is due to flexure, or if the width of the wall piers is less than five times the thickness, analyze the wall as a moment frame. 
5.2.3 Collectors. Wall elements with openings larger than a typical panel at a building corner are connected to the remain­der of the wall with collector reinforcing. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the configuration of the wall or the diaphragm. Find an adequately strong path of forces. If none is found, report this as a deficiency.

SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS 


5.3 Reinforced masonry shear walls. 
5.3.1 Shearing stress check. The building satisfies the Quick Check of the shearing stress in the reinforced masonry shear walls. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Gen­erate the lateral loads using the Quick Check procedure of Sec­tion 2.4.7.3. If vavg is greater than 15 psi, a more detailed evaluation of the structure shall be performed. This evaluation shall employ a more accurate estimation of the level and distri­bution of the lateral loads, using the analysis procedures in Article 2. 
5.3.2 Reinforcing. The total vertical and horizontal reinforcing steel in reinforced masonry walls is greater than 0.002 times the gross area of the wall with a minimum of0.0007 in either of the two directions, the spacing of reinforcing steel is less than 48 inches and all vertical bars extend to the top of the walls. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Ifthe quantity of wall reinforcing is less than the specified amounts, report this condition as a deficiency. 
5.3.3 Reinforcing at openings. All wall openings that inter­rupt rebar have trim reinforcing on all sides. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the lack of reinforcing at the end of wall ele­ments adjacent to openings and at the corners of walls. Check the wall using only the length of piers between reinforcing steel. 
5.4 Unreinforced masonry shear walls. Unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings are automatically classified as SPC 1, unless reclassification is permitted per Section 
1.4.5.1.2. The following provisions apply to unreinforced masonry shear wall structures that also possess a complete ver­ticalload-carrying space frame. 

5.4.1 Shearing stress check. 
The building satisfies the Quick Check of the shearing stress in the unreinforced masonry shear walls. 
Generate the lateral loads using the Quick Check procedure of Section 2.4.7.3. The allowable stress (on the gross area) for solid brick masonry is 10 psi; for hollow unit masonry, 6 psi; and for grouted block masonry, 12.5 psi. If vavg is greater than the allowable stress, an Alternative Analysis of the structure shall be performed, or the building shall be placed in SPC 1. 

5.4.2 Masonry lay-up. 
Filled collar joints of multi wythe masonry walls have negli­gible voids. 
The deficiency is in the lay-up of the wall that left voids between the wythes. Investigate the lay-up. This can be done when masonry units are removed for strength tests. Ifvoids are present, reporl lhis condition as a deficiency. 
5.4.3 Proportions. The height/thickness ratio of the wall pan­
els is as follows: One-story building hjt < 15 
Multistory building 
Top story h,/ t < 9 
Other stories h,/t < 13 

The deficiency is in the out-of-plane strength of the wall. Check the out-of-plane demand using the procedure for parts and portions of a building given in Section 2.4.6. 

5.5 Unreinforced masonry infill walls in frames. 
5.5.1 Proportions. The height/thickness ratio of the wall pan­els is as follows: 
One-story building h" It< 14 
Multistory building 
Top story h,/t < 9 
Other stories hjt < 20 

The deficiency is in the out-of-plane strength of the wall. Check the out-of-plane demand using the procedure for parts and portions of a building given in Section 2.4.6. 
5.5.2 Solid walls. The infill walls are not of cavity construction. 
The deficiency is in the out-of-plane strength of the wall. If infill walls are ofcavity construction, report this as a deficiency. 
5.5.3 Infill walls. The infill walls are continuous to the soffits of the frame beams. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the columns. Check the shear capacity of the columns to develop opposing yield moments at top and bottom of the short free height or to resist required force amplified by the factor Cj2, but not less than 1.5. 
5.5.4 Wall connections. All infill panels are constructed to encompass the frames around their entire perimeter. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the connection of the infill panel to the frame. Determine the panel edge condition from available drawings or from field investigation. If the panels are not properly con­nected to the frame, report this condition as a deficiency. 

5.6 Walls in wood frame buildings. 
5.6.1 Shearing stress check. The building satisfies the Quick Check of the shearing stress in wood shear walls. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Gen­erate the lateral loads using the Quick Check procedure of Sec­tion 2.4.7.3 and compare to 400 pounds per foot of plywood wall or 50 pounds per foot of walls composed ofgypsum board or other materials. If vavg is greater than these values, a more detailed evaluation of the structure shall be performed. This evaluation shall employ a more accurate estimation of the level and distribution of the lateral loads using the analysis proce­dures in Article 2. 
5.6.2 Openings. Walls with garage doors or other large open­ings are braced with plywood shear walls or are supported by adjacent construction through substantial positive ties. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the lateral-force-resisting sys­tem. Check the ability of the walls and diaphragms to control, through torsional capacity, displacements at walls with large openings. Check that the diaphragm is a complete system with chords and collectors provided to deliver the lateral loads as required. 
5.6.3 Wall requirements. All walls supporting tributary area of 24 to 100 square feet per foot of wall are plywood sheathed with proper nailing or rod braced and have a height-to-depth (HID) ratio of 1 to 1 or less or have properly detailed and con­structed hold-downs. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the wall and/or in hold-downs to resist overturning forces. Check the walls using floor areas trib­utary to the walls. Check all portions of the load path to ensure proper force transfer. 
5.6.4 Cripple walls. All exterior cripple walls below the first floor level are braced to the foundation with shear elements. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the shear strength ofthe cripple walls. Check all exterior cripple walls below the first floor level to ensure that they are braced to the foundation with shear elements. 
5.6.5 Narrow shear walls. Narrow wood shear walls with an aspect ratio greater than 2 to 1 do not resist forces developed in the building. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the narrow walls. Determine the shear capacity ofthe wall and related overturning demand. This shear capacity and related overturning must be transferred to the foundation within allowable stresses. 
5.6.6 Stucco (exterior plaster) shear walls. Multistory build­ings do not rely on exterior stucco walls as the primary lat­eral-force-resisting system. 
The deficiency is in the strength of the stucco walls. Inspect stucco-clad buildings to determine if there is a lateral system such as plywood or diagonal sheathing at all but the top floor. Where exterior plaster is present, verify that the wire reinforc­ing is attached directly to the wall framing and the wire is com­pletely embedded into the plaster material. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed into SPC 4. 
5.6.7 Plaster or gypsum wallboard shear walls. Interior plas­ter or gypsum wallboard is not being used for shear walls in buildings over one story in height. 
The deficiency is in the strength of the walls. Determine if there is a lateral system such as plywood or diagonal sheathing at all but the top floor. Multistory buildings shall not rely on interior plaster or gypsum wallboard walls as the primary lat-eral-force-resisting system. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed into SPC 4.

PROCEDURES FOR BRACED FRAMES 

6.0 Introduction. Braced frames develop their resistance to lateral forces by the bracing action of diagonal members. The braces induce forces in the associated beams and columns so that all work together like a truss with all members subjected to stresses that are primarily axial. 
A concentrically braced frame has minor eccentricities in the joints of the frame that are accounted for in the design. 
An eccentrically braced frame has elements that are strictly controlled to combine a stiffening effect due to the diag­onal braces with yielding in the link beams. Eccentrically braced frames are present only in conforming buildings. 
6.1 Concentrically braced frames. 
6.1.1 Stress check. The building satisfies the Quick Check of the stress in the diagonals. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Cal­culate the average axial stress in the diagonals using the proce­dures of Section 2.4.7.4. Increase the calculated stress to account for torsion, based on the amount of torsion (Section 3.3.6) present and the distance between braced frames. If the average stress exceeds 30 ksi, an accurate analysis of the stresses on the bracing elements shall be performed. 
6.1.2 Stiffness ofdiagonals. All diagonal elements required to carry compression have Kllr ratios less than 120. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the stiffness ofthe diagonals. Check the bracing elements, amplifying the seismic force by the factor 1.25. 
6.1.3 Tension-only braces. Tension-only braces are not used as the primary diagonal bracing elements in structures over two stories in height. 
The deficiency is in the strength of the braces. Check the braces. If they are tension-only, and the building is over two stories in height, place the building in SPC 1. Tension-only bracing of small penthouse structures may be reviewed using the procedures in Section 2.4.6. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4. 
6.1.4 Chevron bracing. The bracing system does not include chevron-, V-, or K-braced bays. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check all elements in the braced frames. For chevron-and V-braced frames, the beam shall be a single element that can carry the gravity loads without the intermediate support of the braces. Check the adequacy of the beam for the seismic forces amplified by Cj2, but not less than 1.5. Consider the effect of buckling of a leg of chevron-bracing or V-bracing, including the continuity, strength, and bracing of the beams and the abil­ity of the connection to permit buckling of the brace while not destroying the capacity for repeated cycles of loading. If 
2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE 

K-bracing is used in buildings over two stories, amplify the seismic forces in the bracing and columns by the factor Cj2, but not less than 1.5. 
6.1.5 Concentric joints. All the diagonal braces frame into the beam-column joints concentrically. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the joints. Evaluate the conse­quence of the eccentricity on the member required to resist it. Evaluate the shear, bending and axial force requirements at the locations of eccentricities. 
6.1.6 Connection strength. All the brace connections are able to develop the yield capacity of the diagonals. 
The deficiency is in the strength of the connections. Check the connection strength. Use a demand value that develops the tensile capacity of the brace or is 1.25 times the required seis­mic force. If connections in a conforming building cannot develop the yield capacity of the brace and do not meet the requirements of Part 2, Title 24, Section 2211A.9.3 of 1995 California Building Code (CBC) or equivalent provision in later version ofthe CBC, the building shall be placed in SPC 4. 
6.1.7 Column splices. All column splice details of the braced frames can develop the column yield capacity. 
The deficiency is in the strength of the splice. Calculate the adequacy of the splice connection for all expected forces including gravity loads. Amplify the seismic load for partial penetration welded splices by the factor cd 12 when the seismic load produces tension at the splice. Ifthe column splice details in a conforming building cannot develop the yield capacity of the column and do not meet the requirements ofPart 2, Title 24, Section 2211A.9.5 of 1995 California Building Code (CBC) or equivalent provision in later version of the CBC, the building shall be placed in SPC 4. 
6.1.8 Concrete braced frames. None ofthe braces in the fram­ing system are of reinforced concrete construction. The deficiency is in the ductility of the braced frame. Report this condition as a deficiency, and place nonconforming build­ings in SPC 1. Place conforming buildings in SPC 4. 
6.2 Eccentrically braced frames. 
6.2.1 Link beam location. The link beams are not connected to the columns. 
The deficiency is in the ductility of the link beam-column connection. Report this condition and place the building in SPC4.

PROCEDURES FOR DIAPHRAGMS 


7.0 Introduction. The diaphragm is the horizontal subsystem that distributes lateral load to the vertical subsystems (walls and frames) and that provides lateral support for walls and parapets. 
7.1 Diaphragms. Diaphragms are treated as horizontal beams. The floor (or roof), which is analogous to the web of a wide-flange beam, is assumed to carry the shear; the edge of 
SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS 
the floor (or roof) or a spandrel, which is analogous to the flange, is assumed to carry the flexural stress. 
7.1.1 Plan irregularities. There is significant tensile capacity at reentrant corners or other locations of plan irregularities. For buildings designed and constructed in accordance with the 1989 or later editions of Part 2, Title 24, the evaluator may con­sider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are neces­sary. The deficiency is in the strength of the diaphragm in the vicinity of corners. Evaluate the chord/collector requirements at the reentrant corners and other locations ofplan irregularities by applying the maximum of the diaphragm force and the cal­culated story force to a model of the isolated diaphragm. All elements that can contribute to the tensile capacity at the reentrant corner may be included with appropriate consider­ation given to gravity load stresses. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4. 
7.1.2 Cross ties. There are continuous cross ties between dia­phragm chords. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the adequacy of the path for wall anchorage forces into the diaphragm. A cross tie is a beam or girder that spans the width of the diaphragm, accumulates the wall loads and transfers them, over the full depth of the diaphragms, into the next bay and on to the nearest shear wall or frame. Calculate the wall anchorage forces according to Section 2.4.5, and check that these forces can be developed, element by element, in the diaphragm. 
7.1.3 Reinforcing at openings. There is reinforcing around all diaphragm openings larger than 50 percent of the building width in either major plan dimension. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the diaphragm in the vicinity of the openings. Check the adequacy of the diaphragm to transfer stresses around the opening. 
7.1.4 Openings at shear walls. Diaphragm openings immedi­ately adjacent to the shear walls constitute less than 25 percent of the wall length, and the available length appears sufficient. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the length of diaphragm needed to transfer shear to the wall or frame and to provide lateral support for the wall or frame. 
Procedure for diaphragm shear: Verify that there is a path of forces and sufficient strength to deliver the diaphragm shear to the shear wall. The diaphragm shear is the demand. 
Procedure for lateral support of the wall: Treat the wall as a portion of the building using FP as the demand. 
7 .1.5 Openings at braced frames. Diaphragm openings immediately adjacent to the braced frames extend less than 25 percent of the length of the bracing. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is similar to that described above for openings at shear walls. 
Procedure for diaphragm shear: Verify that there is a path of forces and sufficient strength to deliver the diaphragm shear to the braced frame. The diaphragm shear is the seismic demand. 
Procedure for lateral support of the frame: Treat the frame as a portion of the building using FP as the demand. 
7.1.6 Openings at exterior masonry shear walls. Diaphragm openings immediately adjacent to exterior masonry walls are no more than 8 feet long. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is similar to that described above for openings at shear walls. 
Procedure for diaphragm shear: Verify that there is a path of forces and sufficient strength to deliver the diaphragm shear to the shear wall. The diaphragm shear is the demand. 
Procedure for lateral support of the wall: Treat the wall as a portion of the building using FP as the demand. 
7.2 Wood diaphragms. 
7.2.1 Sheathing. None of the diaphragms consist of straight sheathing or have a span/depth ratio greater than 2 to 1. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the diaphragm. Analyze the wood diaphragm using the procedure given in Chapter 9 of the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions. 
7.2.2 Spans. All diaphragms with spans greater than 24 feet have plywood or diagonal sheathing. Structures in Building Type 2 may have rod-braced systems. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength and stiffness of the diaphragm. Evaluate the diaphragm stresses using the procedure given in Chapter 9 of the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions. Also evaluate the deflections. A maximum displacement of 3 inches shall be acceptable. For horizontal bracing systems, see Sec­tion 7.5. 
7.2.3 Unblocked diaphragms. Unblocked wood panel dia­phragms consist of horizontal spans of less than 40 feet and have span/depth ratios less than or equal to 3 to 1. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the diaphragm. Analyze the dia­phragm using the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions requirements for unblocked diaphragms. 
7.2.4 Span/depth ratio. If the span/depth ratios of wood dia­phragms are greater than 3 to 1, there are nonstructural walls connected to all diaphragm levels at less than 40-foot spacing. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the stiffness of the diaphragm. Analyze the wood diaphragm using the procedures given in Chapter 9 ofthe 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions. 
7.2.5 Diaphragm continuity. None of the diaphragms are composed of split-level floors or, in wood commercial or industrial buildings, have expansion joints. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the diaphragm. Evaluate the building with proper recognition of the effects of the disconti­nuities. 
7.2.6 Chord continuity. All chord elements are continuous, regardless of changes in roof elevation. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is the lack of a chord. Report the lack of a chord as a deficiency. 
7.3 Metal deck diaphragms. Allowable values of metal deck diaphragms may be obtained from the manufacturer's approved data. The evaluator shall consider conditions that can weaken the diaphragm (i.e., troughs, gutters and recesses that have the effect ofreducing the system to the bare deck or ofcre­ating a joint). 
7.3.1 Deck topping. All metal deck roofs have a reinforced concrete topping slab. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the diaphragm. Evaluate the bare metal deck diaphragm using the procedure given in the 1994 NEHRP Recommended Provisions requirements. 
7.3.2 Untopped diaphragms. Untapped metal deck dia­phragms consist of horizontal spans of less than 40 feet and have span/depth ratios less than or equal to 3 to 1. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is in the strength of the diaphragm. Analyze the dia­phragm using the procedure given in the 1994 NEHRP Recom­mended Provisions requirements. 
7.4 Precast concrete diaphragms. Evaluation of precast con­crete diaphragms and the connections between precast ele­ments shall consider eccentricities, adequacy of welds and length of embedded bars. If a topping slab is provided, it shall be assumed to resist all of the shear. 
7.4.1 Topping slab. Precast concrete diaphragm elements are interconnected by a reinforced concrete topping slab. 
The deficiency is in the ability to transfer shear from one ele­ment to another. Check the slab element interconnection and check the lateral load capacity of the vertical elements that resist horizontal force. Where the capacity of the diaphragm is less than 150 percent of the sum of the load capacities of the vertical elements and where connections can allow the dia­phragm to fail in a brittle manner, the R values used in comput­ing the seismic demand shall be consistent with those for brittle systems (not to exceed R =2). Conforming buildings without a reinforced concrete topping slab shall be placed in SPC 4. 
7.4.2 Continuity of topping slab. The topping slab continues uninterrupted through the interior walls and into the exterior walls or is provided with dowels with a total area equal to the topping slab reinforcing. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is the abrupt loss of strength where the topping slab

SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS 
is interrupted. Evaluate the tension and shear demand due to diaphragm forces, including collector requirements, perpen­dicular-to-wall loads, or chord forces at re-entrant comers. 
7.5 Horizontal bracing. Horizontal bracing forms a complete system of adequate capacity. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is an incomplete or inadequate horizontal bracing system. Evaluate the horizontal bracing system for complete­ness of the system and its ability to gather all tributary forces and deliver them to the walls or frames. 
7.6 Other systems. The diaphragm system does not include thin planks and/or toppings of gypsum. 
The deficiency is the inadequate capacity of the diaphragm. Conforming buildings with this condition shall be placed in SPC4.

8.0 Introduction. The connections evaluated in this article are connections between: 
• 	
Framing members and walls; 

• 	
Diaphragms and walls or frames; and 

• 	
Walls or frames and foundations. 



Connections between other structural members are dis­cussed in the appropriate article. 
8.1 Connection concerns. The evaluation of these specific connections involves review of: 
• 	
Lateral support of walls that are perpendicular to the direction of the earthquake ("normal walls"); 

• 	
Transfer of shear from diaphragms to shear walls and frames that are parallel to the direction of the earth­quake; 

• 	
Anchorage of walls and columns to the foundations; and 

• 	
Interconnection of elements where failure of connec­tions would jeopardize the system. 



8.2 Anchorage for normal forces. 
8.2.1 Wood ledgers. The connection between the wall panels and the diaphragm does not induce cross-grain bending or ten­sion in the wood ledgers.

8.2.7 Inadequate stiffness of wall anchors. Anchors of walls to wood structural elements are installed taut and are stiff enough to prevent movement between the wall and roof. 
The deficiency is in the ability of the wall anchor to prevent separations between the wall and roof sheathing that may result in out-of-plane failure ofthe ledger support. Inspect all anchors to see that they do not have twists, kinks, offsets, or are other­wise installed so that some movement is required before the anchor becomes effective, and that this condition may lead to cross grain bending in the ledger. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4. 
8.3 Shear transfer. 
8.3.1 Transfer to shear walls. Diaphragms have sufficient capacity and are connected for transfer of loads to the shear walls.

The deficiency is in the strength of the pilaster at the girder anchorage. Report this condition as a deficiency. Conforming buildings that fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4. 
8.5.2 Corbel bearing. Ifthe frame girders bear on column cor­bels, the length of bearing is greater than 3 inches. 
The deficiency is in the length of bearing. Calculate the inter-story drift.

Conforming buildings that fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4. 
8.5.3 Corbel connections. The frame girders are not supported on corbels with welded elements. 
The deficiency is in the strength of the connection. Check all welded connections that transfer lateral loads or are subject to frame action. Determine where connection failures would be brittle (e.g., pull-out of embedded item would occur before yield of mild steel element). Analyze structure for capacity without such connections or check such connections for seis­mic force amplified by factor Cd 12, but not less than 1.5. For connections that can allow the diaphragm to fail in a brittle manner, the R values used in computing the seismic demand shall be consistent with those for brittle systems (not to exceed R =2). Conforming buildings that fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4. 
8.6 Roof decking.

PROCEDURES FOR FOUNDATIONS 
AND GEOLOGIC SITE HAZARDS 


9.0 Introduction. The seismic evaluation of an existing build­ing shall include an examination of the building foundation, an assessment of the capability of the soil beneath the foundation to withstand the forces applied during an earthquake and an evaluation of any nearby geologic hazards that may affect the stability of the foundation. 
9.1 Condition of foundations. 
9.1.1 Foundation performance. The structure does not show evidence ofexcessive foundation movement such as settlement or heave that would affect its integrity or strength. 
The deficiency is reduction of the integrity and strength of foundation elements by cracking, yielding, tipping or buckling of the foundation. Visually examine lower level walls, parti­tions, grade beams, visible footings, pile caps and the like for cracking, yielding, buckling and out-of-level conditions. Report evidence of movement as a deficiency. 
9.1.2 Deterioration. There is no evidence that foundation ele­ments have deteriorated due to corrosion, sulphate attack, material breakdown or other reasons in a manner that would affect the integrity or strength of the structure. 
The deficiency is weakening ofthe foundation due to deteri­oration, with the same consequences as discussed in Section 
9 .1.1. Determine if there is historical evidence in the local area ofdeterioration ofthe particular type offoundation elements in the building where site conditions are similar. Examine the vis­ible foundation elements for evidence of loss of support as specified in Section 9 .1.1. 
9.2 Capacity of foundations. 
9.2.1 Overturning. The ratio of the effective horizontal dimen­sion, at the foundation level of the seismic-resisting system, to the building height (base/height) exceeds 1.4 Av. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is the concentration of seismic inertial response into narrow elements by the seismic-resisting system, which may overcome the ability of the foundation elements, either struc­ture or soil, to provide adequate resistance. For shallow foun­dations, evaluate the shear and moment capacity of the foundation elements for adequacy to resist calculated seismic forces. Evaluate the vertical bearing pressure of the soil under seismic loading conditions due to the total gravity and over­turning loads and compare to two times the allowable static-bearing pressure. For deep foundations, evaluate the ulti­mate vertical capacity of the pile or pier under seismic loads. Compare the foundation capacity to the gravity loads plus the overturning loads. 
9.2.2 Ties between foundation elements. Foundation ties adequate for seismic forces exist where footings, piles and piers are not restrained by beams, slabs, or competent soils or rock. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is the possibility of significant differential lateral 
SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS 
deformations of the foundations. Evaluate the lateral restraint to seismic forces provided by the foundation materials or the structural ties. For shallow foundations, evaluate the horizontal capacity of the foundation soils under seismic loading condi­tions (the lateral resistance of the footings due to passive resis­tance on affected sides of the footings plus the friction on the base ofthe footings) and compare to the base shear ofthe build­ing. In the evaluation of base friction, consideration shall be given to the effect ofthe vertical component ofground motion. 
9.2.3 Load path at pile caps. The pile caps are capable of transferring overturning and lateral forces between the struc­ture and individual piles in the pile cap. 
The deficiency is insufficient capacity of the pile cap to transfer seismic forces from the superstructure to the individual piles. Check the moment and shear capacity to transfer uplift and lateral forces from the point of application on the pile cap to each pile. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4. 
9.2.4 Lateral force on deep foundations. Piles and piers are capable of transferring the lateral forces between the structure and the soil. 
The deficiencies include inadequate flexural strength and ductility of piles or piers at the connection to the cap and the upper pmtion of the pile. Compare the maximum lateral resis­tance of soil against piles or piers and caps against the demand. For concrete piles, check for a minimal amount of longitudinal reinforcement in the upper portion ofpiles or piers and for hoops or ties immediately beneath the caps. Also check for confining transverse reinforcement wherever bending moments might be high, including changes in soil stiffness. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4. 
9.2.5 Pole buildings. Pole foundations have adequate embedment. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. The deficiency is inadequate strength ofthe pole foundation. Check lateral force resistance of embedded poles using conventional procedures, comparing with conventional allowable pressures times 1.5. 
9.2.6 Sloping sites. The grade difference from one side of the building to another does not exceed one-half story. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. If this statement is false, include the horizontal force due to the grade difference, appropriately modified for seismic motions, with the seismic inertial force when checking sliding stability and the lateral-force-resisting system below grade. 
9.3 Geologic site hazards. This section addresses geologic and local site conditions that can lead to building structural damage and threaten life safety in an earthquake. In the seismic evaluation of buildings for life-safety considerations, it will be necessary to investigate the site to establish that there are no geologic site hazards present or, if they are present, that their threat is not significant or is mitigated by the design. Require­ments for engineering geologic reports are given in Section 
2.1.2. 
9.3.1 Liquefaction. Liquefaction susceptible, saturated, loose granular soils that could jeopardize the building's seismic per­formance do not exist in the foundation soils at depths within 50 feet under the building. 
The deficiency is the potential for liquefaction that will result in vertical settlement and potential loss of foundation support for spread footings, or for lateral spreading ofliquefied soils that can occur on nearly flat slopes and be detrimental to the foundation system. Evaluate the liquefaction potential and consequences of vertical settlement or lateral movement of the foundations. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4. 
9.3.2 Slope failure. The building site is sufficiently remote from potential earthquake-induced slope failures or rockfalls to be unaffected by such failures or is capable of accommodat­ing small predicted movements without failure. 
Evaluate the likely movements associated with seismically induced slope failures beneath, above or adjacent to the building and their effect on the structural integrity of the building. Con­forming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4. 
9.3.3 Surface fault rupture. Surface fault rupture and surface displacement at the building site are not anticipated. 
Evaluate the proximity of known active faults to the build­ing. If the potential for surface fault rupture and surface dis­placement at the building site is present, nonconforming buildings shall be placed in SPC 1. Conforming buildings which fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4. 
ARTICLE 10 
EVALUATION OF ELEMENTS THAT ARE NOT PART 
OF THE LATERAL-FORCE-RESISTING SYSTEM 

10.0 Introduction. This article sets forth general requirements that apply to nonstructural elements related to life-safety issues. Article 11 addresses evaluation of critical nonstructural systems needed for continued hospital function following an earthquake, and assignment of buildings to Nonstructural Per­formance Categories. 
The evaluation statements discussed in this article (and listed in the appendix) deal with life-safety concems. Some of the statements can be answered directly. For others, further investi­gation will be required in accordance with evaluation procedures indicated in other articles of these regulations using seismic forces indicated in Section 2.4.6 and the appropriate Cc seismic coefficient given in Table 2.4.3.1. Also, the materials used in the nonstructural element and its connections must be considered. 
10.1 Nonstructural walls. The term "nonstructural walls" refers to walls that are not part of the load-carrying system, but may become load bearing upon attachment and interaction with other elements. Evaluation must be made to determine if they are capable of resisting seismic forces required by Section 
2.4.6 as well as the other requirements of these regulations. 
10.1.1 Partitions. 
10.1.1.1 Masonry partitions. There are no unbraced unreinforced masonry or hollow clay tile partitions in critical care areas, clinical laboratory service spaces, pharmaceutical service spaces, radiological service spaces, central and sterile supply areas, exit conidors, elevator shafts or stairwells. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check for the presence of support angles at floor and roof, and for spaces at the sides and top of the wall to provide for interac­tion of the structural system. 
10.1.1.2 Structural separations. At structural separations, partitions in exit corridors have seismic or control joints. 
Check that seismic and/or control joints have been provided at structural separations. Conforming buildings that fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4. 
10.1.1.3 Partition bracing. In exit corridors, the tops of parti­tions that extend only to the ceiling line have lateral bracing. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Parti­tions extending only to ceilings may overturn or buckle due to the lack of bracing. 
10.1.2 Cladding and veneer. For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider these conditions as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Exterior wall panels or cladding can fall iftheir connections to the building frames have insufficient strength and/or ductility. 
10.1.2.1 Masonry veneer. Masonry veneer is connected to the back-up with corrosion-resistant ties spaced 24 inches on cen­ter maximum with at least one tie for every 22 square feet. 
/3 

For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check for the presence of the required ties. 
10.1.2.2 Cladding panels in moment frame buildings. For moment frame buildings of steel or concrete, panels are iso­lated from the structural frame to absorb predicted interstory drift without collapse. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check the ability of the cladding panels and their connections to tolerate the story drift computed in Section 2.4.4 without an anchorage failure. 
10.1.2.3 Cladding panel connections. Where bearing connec­tions are required, there are at least two bearing connections for each cladding panel and there are at least four connections for each cladding panel capable of resisting out-of-plane forces. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Ver­ify that an adequate number of the appropriate connection types are present for each cladding panel. 
10.1.2.4 Cladding panel condition. Cladding panel connec­tions appear to be installed properly. No connection element is severely deteriorated or conoded. There is no cracking in the panel materials indicative of substantial structural distress. There is no substantial damage to exterior cladding due to water leakage. There is no substantial damage to exterior wall cladding due to temperature movements. 
Substantial deterioration can lead to loss of cladding ele­ments or panels. Exterior walls shall be checked for deteriora­
2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE 

tion. Damage due to corrosion, rotting, freezing or erosion can be concealed within the wall. Probe into the wall space, if nec­essary, for signs of water leakage at vulnerable interior spaces (e.g., around windows and at floor areas). Check elements that tie cladding to the backup structure and that tie the back-up structure to floor and roof slabs. Check exterior walls for crack­ing due to thermal movements. Check the cladding systems with appropriate reductions in member capacities. Conforming buildings that fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4. 
10.1.3 Metal stud back-up systems. 
10.1.3.1 General. Additional steel studs frame window and door openings. Corrosion of veneer ties, tie screws, studs and stud tracks is minimal. Stud tracks are adequately fastened to the structural frame. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Verify that adequate framing has been provided around openings in the exterior walls. Check the cladding systems with appropriate reductions in member capacities. Check the adequacy of the connection to the structural frame using the forces specified in Section 2.4.6. 
10.1.3.2 Masonry veneer with stud back-up. Masonry veneer more than 30 feet above the ground is supported by shelf angles or other elements at each floor level. Masonry veneer is ade­quately anchored to the back-up at locations of through-wall flashing. Masonry veneer is connected to the back-up with cor­rosion-resistant ties spaced 24 inches on center maximum and with at least one tie for every 22 square feet. 
/3 

For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check that adequate supports and ties are provided. 
10.1.4 Masonry veneer with concrete block back-up. 
10.1.4.1 General. The concrete block back-up qualifies as rein­forced masonry. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Ver­ify that the concrete block back-up meets the requirements of Sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3. 
10.1.4.2 Masonry veneer support. Masonry veneer more than 30 feet above the ground is supported by shelf angles or other elements at each floor level. Masonry veneer is adequately anchored to the back-up at locations of through-wall flashing. Masonry veneer is connected to the back-up with corro­sion-resistant ties spaced 24 inches on center maximum and with at least one tie for every 22 square feet. The concrete block 
/3 

back-up is positively anchored to the structural frame at 4-foot maximum intervals along the floors and roofs. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check that adequate supports and ties are provided. 
10.1.5 Other veneer/panel systems. 
10.1.5.1 Thin stone veneer panels. Stone anchorages are ade­quate for computed loads. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. There 
SEISMIC EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS 
are no visible cracks or weak veins in the stone. Check the ade­quacy of the connection to the stone anchorage using the forces specified in Section 2.4.6. 
10.1.5.2 Wood/aggregate panels. There is no visible deterio­ration of screws or wood at panel attachment points. 
The deficiency is in the strength of the connections. Deter­mine the cause and extent of distress and check the attachment ofthe panels with appropriate reductions in capacity. Conform­ing buildings that fail this check shall be placed in SPC 4. 
10.1.6 Parapets, cornices, ornamentation and appendages. There are no laterally unsupported unreinforced masonry para­pets or cornices above the highest anchorage level with height/ thickness ratios greater than 1.5. Concrete parapets with height/thickness ratios greater than 1.5 have vertical reinforce­ment. Cornices, parapets, signs and other appendages that extend above the highest anchorage level or cantilever from exterior wall faces and other exterior wall ornamentation are reinforced and well anchored to the structural system. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. If any of these items are of insufficient strength and/or are not securely attached to the structural elements, they may break off and fall, becoming significant life-safety hazards. Check the adequacy of these items using the forces specified in Section 
2.4.6. The maximum height of an unbraced URM parapet shall be determined based on the height dimension measured above the lower ofeither the level oftension anchors or roof sheathing to the top of the wall parapet. The minimum height of a parapet above the wall anchor should be 12 inches. 
Exception: If a reinforced concrete beam is provided at the top of the wall, the minimum height above the wall anchor may be 6 inches. 
10.1.7 Means of egress. Canopies are anchored and braced to prevent collapse and blockage of building exits. 
For conforming buildings, the evaluator may consider this condition as mitigated, and no calculations are necessary. Check canopies for the forces specified in Section 2.4.6.

Section approval stamp; and c) a five-digit project number on the approval that begins with the "H" prefix, are required to demonstrate that the instal­lation conforms to Part 2, Title 24. It shall also be demonstrated by a written report submitted by the structural engineer, acceptable to the enforcement agency, that an investigation of the anchorage and bracing of components and equipment identified in Section 11.2.1(a) shows it to be constructed in reasonable conformity with these drawings. 

Anchorage and bracing of elements that comply with either of these conditions are considered to meet the requirements of NPC 2. 
Installation is defined as that which shows the size and type ofmaterial for all components of the system, includ­ing the anchor or fastener manufacturer (if proprietary), type, total number and embedment if connected to struc­tural concrete, masonry or wood. 

d) If the components and equipment inventoried in 11.2.1(b) is anchored or braced, but does not meet the requirements of Section 11.2.1 (c), determine if the brac­ing and anchorage is sufficient to meet the code require­ments specified in Table 11.1. The bracing capacity shall be determined by calculations based upon information shown in the construction documents. If these docu­ments are incomplete or unavailable, the evaluation shall be based on the as-built conditions, with the capacity of fasteners to masonry, concrete or wood determined by approved tests; and 
e) 	If any of the items inventoried in 11.2.l(b) are unan­chored or inadequately braced as determined by Section 
11.2.1(d), the building shall be placed in NPC 1. 

11.2.2 Evaluation procedures for NPC 3 and NPC 3R. The following steps shall determine if the building meets the crite­ria for NPC 3 or NPC 3R: 
a) 	Identify the specific nonstructural components and equipment that are subject to the requirements of NPC 2 and NPC 3 or NPC 3R;

Exception: Any general acute care hospital facility located in both a "rural area" as defined in Section 70059.1, Division 5, Title 22 and Seismic Zone 3 pur­suant to 1995 California Building Code (CBC) or later version of the CBC shall comply with the fire sprinkler system anchorage and bracing requirements of NFPA 13, 1994 edition or subsequent standard by January 1, 2013. 

c) Determine the level of NPC 3 conformance desired. 
1. 	Buildings classified as SPC 1 or SPC 2 are permit­ted to meet the NPC 3 performance level, or the NPC 3R performance level. See also Section 11.2.3(c). 

2. 	Buildings classified as SPC 3 or higher must meet the NPC 3 performance level. 
d) 	Determine if the anchorage or bracing of the identified components and equipment complies with the following conditions:

Installed under a permit issued by OSHPD. Draw­ings showing the installation and bearing an OSHPD approval stamp are required to show that the installation conforms to Part 2, Title 24; or 

2. 	
Reviewed and approved by the Department of General Services, Office of Architecture and Con­struction, Structural Safety Section. Drawings showing: a) the installation; b) bear an Office of Architecture and Construction, Structural Safety Section approval stamp; and c) a five-digit project number on the approval stamp that begins with an "H" prefix, are required to demonstrate that the installation conforms to Part 2, Title 24. It shall also be demonstrated by a written report submitted by the structural engineer, acceptable to the enforcement agency, that an investigation of the anchorage and bracing of components and equip­ment identified in Section 11.2.2(a) shows it to be constructed in reasonable conformity with these drawings. 


Anchorage and bracing of elements that comply with either of these conditions are considered to meet the requirements of NPC 2 and NPC 3 or NPC 3R. 
Installation is defined as that which shows the size and type of material for all components of the system including the anchor or fastener manufacturer (if proprietary), type, total number and embedment if connected to structural concrete, masonry or wood. 
e) 	If the components and equipment inventoried in 11.2.2(b) are anchored or braced, but do not meet the requirements of Section 11.2.2( d), determine if the brac­ing and anchorage is sufficient to meet the code require­ments specified in Table 11.1 for NPC 3 or NPC 3R. The bracing capacity shall be determined by calculations based upon information shown in the construction docu­ments. Ifthese documents are incomplete or unavailable, the evaluation shall be based on the as-built conditions, with the capacity of fasteners to masonry, concrete, or wood determined by approved tests. For NPC 3R, the investigation of the adequacy of anchorage and bracing may be limited to the connection of the component or equipment to the support when the total reaction at the point of support (including the application of FP) is less than: 
1. 	
250 pounds for components or equipment attached to light frame walls. For the purposes of this requirement, the sum of the absolute value of all reactions due to component loads on a single stud shall not exceed 250 pounds. 

2. 	
1,000 pounds for components or equipment attached to roofs, or walls ofreinforced concrete or masonry construction. 


2013 CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE 
3. 2,000 pounds for components or equipment 
attached to floors or slabs-on-grade. Exception: Ifthe anchorage or bracing is con­figured in a manner that results in significant torsion on a supporting structural element, the effects ofthe nonstructural reaction force on the structural element shall be considered in the anchorage design. 
t) 	If any of the items inventoried in 11.2.2(b) are inade­quately anchored or braced, as determined by Section 11.2.2( d), the building shall be placed in NPC 2. 

11.2.3 Evaluation procedures for NPC 4. The following steps shall be followed to determine if the building meets the criteria for NPC 4: 
a) Identify the specific nonstructural components and equipment that are subject to the requirements of NPC 2 through NPC 4; 
b) Conduct an inventory of components and equipment specified in Table 11.1, NPC 2 through NPC 4, noting whether the components and equipment are anchored or braced; 
c) 	Determine if the anchorage or bracing of the identified components and equipment complies with one of the fol­lowing conditions: 
1. 	
Installed under a permit issued by OSHPD. Draw­ings showing the installation and bearing an OSHPD approval stamp are required to show that the installation conforms to Part 2, Title 24. Instal­lation or retrofit ofcomponents that were designed to meet NPC 3R requirements must be shown to meet the anchorage and bracing requirements of the California Building Code for new construc­tion. Components designed to meet NPC 3R requirements that do not meet the anchorage and bracing requirements for new construction shall be retrofitted to meet those requirements; or

11.3 Testing requirements for evaluating the performance of existing mechanical fasteners. A testing program shall be instituted to determine the capacity of mechanical fasteners used to anchor non structural components including the bracing of pipes, ducts and conduit, and the attachment of equipment and other components listed in the 1995 CBC, Part 2, Title 24, Table 16A-O. Anchors shall be categorized as either seismic bracing of pipes ducts or conduit or equipment and other component anchors. 
11.3.1 Anchors used in the seismic bracing of pipes, ducts or conduit. For anchors used in the seismic bracing of pipes, ducts or conduit, the following shall apply: 
1. 	Twenty percent of the anchors (20 minimum) of a given size and type (wedge, shell and sleeve for expansion bolts), at each level of the structure shall be tension tested to three times the maximum calculated design load spec­ified in Section 1630B of 1998 California Building Code (CBC) or equivalent provision in later version of the CBC but not less than 500 pounds. A minimum of one anchor in any 4-bolt group shall be tested assuming an equal distribution of the calculated force to the bolt group. One-quarter (1/4)-inch diameter anchors need not be tested. Where none of the anchors in the group have calculated tension, testing shall consist of torque testing. 
Exception: Internally threaded anchors, such as shell-type anchors, shall be tested to four times the maximum calculated design loads. Attachment hard­ware shall be shimmed or removed prior to testing so that it does not prevent the possible withdrawal of the anchor. 

2. 	Ifan anchor fails the tension test, 20 anchors, installed by the same trade, in the immediate vicinity of the failed anchor shall be tested prior to resuming to a 20 percent sampling rate for testing. 
11.3.2 Anchors used in the attachment of equipment and other components. For anchors used in the attachment of equipment and other components listed in the 1995 CBC, Part 2, Title 24, Table 16A-O, the following shall apply: 
1. 	A minimum ofone anchor ofa given size shall be tension tested for each piece of equipment or other component under consideration. Where the number of anchors for the piece of equipment or component exceeds four, a minimum of 20 percent of the anchors shall be tension tested. Where none of the anchors in the group have cal­culated tension, testing shall consist of torque testing. 
2. 	
The tension test load shall be three times the maximum tension force calculated for an anchor in the attachment group using the design loads specified in Section 1630B of 1998 California Building Code (CBC) or equivalent provision in later version of the CBC or 500 pounds min­imum. One-quarter (1/4)-inch diameter anchors need not be tested. 

Exception: Internally threaded anchors, such as shell type anchors, shall be tested to four times the maxi­mum calculated design loads. Attachment hardware shall be shimmed or removed prior to testing so that it does not prevent the possible withdrawal of the anchor. 

3. 	
If a single anchor fails, all anchors in the attachment group shall be tested. If two or more anchors fail, the component shall be retrofitted for the forces as for new construction. 


11.3.3 Tension testing procedure. 
1. 	
Testing of anchors shall be accomplished by the applica­tion of externally applied direct tension force to the anchor. The testing apparatus shall not restrict the proba­ble shear cone failure surface ofthe concrete or masonry. 

2. 	
Torque testing is not permitted in lieu of tension testing unless specifically allowed in these provisions. 

3. 	
A failure is defined when the tension load on the anchor produces a slip of 1/ 8 inch, a shear cone failure in the con­crete or masonry, concrete splitting, or fracture of the steel anchor itself prior to attaining the test load value. 


Exception: For internally threaded anchors, the allowable slip shall not exceed 1/ 16 inch. 
11.3.4 Alternate test criteria. In lieu of testing in accordance with Section 11.3.1 or 11.3.2, a test load may be established by the evaluating engineer. The allowable load that the anchor can resist shall be determined by dividing the test load by the appropriate factors noted in Section 11.3.1 or 11.3.2. No one-third increase is permitted for seismic or wind loads. 
11.3.5 Allowable shear loads. Allowable shear loads on anchors shall be determined by either of the following: 
1. 	
Shear values listed in Table 19B-E of 1998 California Building Code (CBC) or equivalent provision in later version of the CBC, or 

2. 	
Shear values shall be obtained by analysis using Strength Design of Anchorage to Concrete, Section A.6, pub­lished by the Portland Cement Association, 1999, with the specified reduction coefficient(s) to convert the "strength" values to allowable stress design values of

APPENDIX H TO CHAPTER 6 
HAZUS AEBM REGULATIONS 

6-Al HAZUS AEBM technology. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)/National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) Multi-Hazard Loss Estimation Technology (HAZUS-MH MR2) and, specifically, the HAZUS Advanced Engineering Building Module (AEBM) are used by the Office with building-specific parameters, described in this appendix, to evaluate the Probability of Collapse of SPC-1 buildings. 
6-A2 Probability of collapse. The Probability of Collapse, P[COLl, is calculated by Equation (A6-1): 
P[COL]=P[COLjSTR5]XP[STR5] 	(A6-1) 
where:  
P[COLjSTR5]  =  collapse factor of the HAZUS AEBM, as modified herein, and  
P[STR5]  probability of Complete Structural Damage, based on HAZUS AEBM methods and parameters, as modified herein.  

6-A3 Building-specific properties. Building-specific proper­ties are based on the building type (structural system), or Model Building Type (MBT), building height (number of stories above seismic base), building age (pre-1933, 1933-1961 or post-1961 design vintage), availability of materials testing data, and Significant Structural Deficiencies. 
Table A6-1 lists Significant Structural Deficiencies. Table A6-1 includes older buildings (pre-1933 buildings) and build­ings that do not have available materials test data, and treats these conditions as Significant Structural Deficiencies. 
SPC-1 buildings with no Significant Structural Deficiencies are evaluated using "Baseline" values of building-specific properties. SPC-1 buildings with one or more Significant Structural Deficiencies are evaluated using Sub-Baseline (SubBase), or Ultra-Sub-Baseline (USB) building-specific properties, as specified in Table A6-1. 
Building-specific properties include parameters related to 

(1) building capacity, (2) building response, (3) Complete Structural Damage, and (4) building collapse. Appendix H Sections 6-A4 through 6-A7, define the parameters of interest related to building capacity, building response, Complete Structural Damage and building collapse, respectively, and specify appropriate values of these parameters. 
6-A4. Building capacity. Building-specific capacity proper­ties of interest include the yield capacity control point (D, A) and the ultimate capacity control point (D,, A), as calculated by Equations (A6-2 through A6-5, respectively): 
Ay = 	C, ·y/a, (A6-2)

y = 	yield strength factor, Gamma-values of yare given in Table A6-5, 
A = 	"overstrength" factor, Lambda-values of Aare given in Table A6-5, and 
11 = 	"ductility" factor, Mu -values of 11 are given in Table A6-6. 
6-AS Building response. Building-specific response parame­ters of interest include the elastic damping factor, ~E' and the degradation factor, Kappa. Values of ~E are given in Table A6-7 and values of the Kappa factor are given in Table A6-8. 
6-A-6 Complete structural damage. Building-specific dam­age parameters of interest include the median spectral displace­ment of the Complete Structural Damage state, SdC' and the associated lognormal standard deviation (Beta) factor, ~c Val­ues of ~c are given in Table A6-11. Median spectral displace­ment at the Complete Structural Damage state, SdC' is calculated using Equation (A6-6): 
sd,C = 	L),c. HR. <X/<X3 (A6-6) 
where: 
L).c = 	interstory drift ratio (of the story with maximum drift) at the threshold of Complete Structural Damage-val­ues of L).c are given in Table A6-9, 
HR = 	height of building at the roof level, in inches -default values of HR are given in Table A6-3 as a function of the number of stories above grade,

(b) Changes that do not materially alter the work. The following types of changes in the work do not materially alter the work and do not require the submission of amended con­struction documents to the Office: 
1. 	
Clarification and interpretation of plans and specifica­tions by the responsible design professional. 

Note: If calculations by the structural engineer in responsible charge, or by the delegated structural engineer, are necessary to determine structural or nonstructural adequacy, an amended construction document submittal must be made to the Office for review. 


2. 	
Construction means and methods, such as construction sequencing, coordination of the work, and methods of assembly/construction. Construction means and meth­ods do not include work that would require Alternate Method of Compliance or an Alternate Means of Pro­tection. 

Note: Temporary construction, such as temporary exiting, temporary air handlers, temporary bulk oxy­gen tanks, or temporary shoring supporting an occu­pied building under Office jurisdiction are not considered means and methods and thus would require a separate permit or the submittal of an amended construction document to the Office for review. 


3. 	
Substitution of equipment, products, or materials. The equipment, product or material substituted must be code compliant; perform the same function as the equipment, product, or material that it is replacing; must not increase the mechanical or electrical loads to the building systems; must not increase loads to lateral or gravity load-bearing structural frame members; and must meet the design requirements for the project.

Note: Applicable code sections and minimum dimen­sion and space requirements must be shown on plans for confirmation by Office field staff. 

7. 	
Relocation of doors, windows, electrical switches and outlets, plumbing fixtures, etc., that do not require addi­tional changes to the work to make the relocation code compliant. 

8. 	
Relocation or reconfiguration ofcabinetry that does not affect code required minimum dimensions and clear­ances, minimum room or space requirements, or mini­mum storage requirements. Such cabinetry reconfiguration shall not increase loads to supporting members, such as wall studs and ceiling framing. 


Note: Applicable code sections and minimum dimen­sions and space requirements must be shown on plans for confirmation by Office field staff. 
Ifthe architect or engineer in responsible charge of a project determines that plans and/or specifications are necessary for a change that does not materially alter the work, all such plans or specifications shall be stamped and signed by the appropriate design professional(s) pursuant to Section 7-115. All changes in the work are subject to concurrence of the Office field staff as to whether or not the change materially alters the work. 
(c) 
Code compliance. Changes in the work that do not require amended construction documents shall not be deemed to grant authorization for any work to be done in violation of the provisions of any applicable code. 

(d) 
Changes in scope. At the discretion of the Office, amended construction documents that are outside the scope of the original project may be required to be submitted as a sepa­rate project. 

(e)

Revocation of certification may occur when the Office determines that reasonable grounds exist. 
The Office field staff or third parties may propose the sus­pension/revocation of a certification to the Office based on evi­dence of a certificate holder's misrepresentation(s), incompetence and/or malfeasance consistent with these regu­lations. The Office shall investigate the alleged misconduct of the certificate holder, gather evidence related to the incident(s) in question, and interview witnesses, if appropriate. Based upon consideration of the evidence presented, the Office shall determine whether or not reasonable grounds exist for the sus­pension/revocation of certification.

A formal interview may be conducted in person or by telephone. The Office shall make a final determination as to the suspension/revocation after considering all of the evidence on record, including the formal interview and/or any additional information submitted by the certificate holder. Written notification of the Office's final determination will be provided to the certificate holder within 15 days. 
(b) Suspension is appropriate when: 1) a certificate holder negligently commits an act amounting to one or more grounds of revocation; 2) a certificate holder acts with negli­gence/incompetence in the performance of inspection duties; 3) the evidence demonstrates a single or isolated incident rather than a course of negligent/incompetent conduct on the part of the certificate holder in question; and/or 4) the Office deter­mines that other factors, including but not limited to mitigating circumstances or facts relating to the certificate holder's course of conduct, support the suspension of certification in lieu of revocation. 
A certification may be suspended for a minimum of one month to a maximum of eighteen months. The duration of sus­pension will be determined by the Office upon consideration of all of the evidence on record, and account for the severity of the action(s) constituting grounds for suspension. 
(c) 
Revocation is appropriate when: 1) a certificate holder knowingly or willfully commits an act amounting to one or more grounds for revocation; 2) a certificate holder acts with gross negligence/incompetence in the performance of inspec­tion duties; 3) the evidence demonstrates a history of repeated or continuous deviations from the general standard of care in the inspection industry; and/or 4) the Office determines that other factors, including but not limited to damages to third par­ties or facts related to the certificate holder's course ofconduct, justify the revocation of the certification. 

(d) 
Appeal of any suspension or revocation by the certificate holder may be made to the Hospital Building Safety Board pur­suant to Article 5 of these regulations, including an expedited appeal as described in Section 7-173.

10-111. Certification and labeling of fenestration product U-factors, solar heat gain coefficients and air leakage. This section establishes rules for implementing labeling and certifi­cation requirements relating to U-factors, solar heat gain coef-II ficients (SHGCs), visible transmittance (VT), and air leakage for fenestration products under Section 110.6(a) ofPart 6. This section also provides for designation of the National Fenestra­tion Rating Council (NFRC) as the supervisory entity responsi­ble for administering the state's certification program for fenestration products, provided NFRC meets specified criteria. 
(a) Labeling requirements. 
1. 	Temporary labels. 
A. Every manufactured fenestration product shall have 
attached to it a clearly visible temporary label that lists the U-factor, the solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) and Visible Transmittance (VT) and that certifies compliance with the air leakage require­ments of Section 110.6(a)l. For the Component Modeling Approach (CMA), site-built fenestration products shall have a label certificate that lists the U-factor, the Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC), and the Visible Transmittance (VT). 

B. U-factor, SHGC and VT shall be determined by either: 
i. 	Fenestration products rated and certified using NFRC 100, NFRC 200, NFRC 202, NFRC 203 

II 
or NFRC 400 Rating Procedures. The manufac­turer shall stipulate that the ratings were deter­mined in accordance with applicable NFRC procedures. For manufactured fenestration products, a temporary label certificate approved by the supervisory entity (NFRC) meets theII requirements of this section. For component modeling and site-built fenestration products, a label certificate approved by the supervisory entity (NFRC) meets the requirements of this section. 
ii. 	For manufactured or site-built fenestration products not rated by NFRC, a temporary label with the words "CEC Default U-factor," fol­lowed by the appropriate default U-factor speci­

II 	fied in Section 110.6(a)2 and with the words "CEC Default SHGC," followed by the appro­priate default SHGC specified in Section 110.6(a)3 and with the words "CEC Default VT," followed by the appropriate VT as speci­fied in Section 110.6(a)4, meets the require­ments of this Subsection B. 
II 
II C. Temporary labels shall also certify that the product complies with the air leakage requirements of Sec­tion 110.6(a)l of the Standards. 
2. 	Permanent labels. NFRC Rated products shall have a permanent label that is either a stand-alone label, an extension or tab of an existing permanent certification label being used by the manufacturer/responsible party, or series of marks or etchings on the product. The per­
II 
manent label, coupled with observable product charac­teristics, can be used to trace the product to certification information on file with the supervisory entity or to a directory of certified products, published by the super­

II 	visory entity. For CMA and site-built fenestration prod­ucts, a label certificate approved by the supervisory entity meets the requirements of this section. 
Exception to Section 10-111(a): Field-fabricated fenestration products. 

(b) Certification requirements. 
1. 	Certification to default ratings. The manufacturer shall certify on the Default Label that the product's U-factor, SHGC and VT meets the default criteria in Sections 110.6(a)2, 110.6(a)3 and 110.6(a)4; and 
A. A temporary label, affixed to the product, that meets the requirements of Section 10-lll(a)IB meets this requirement. 
B. Ifthe product claims the default U-factor for a ther­mal break product, the manufacturer shall also cer­tify on the label that the product meets the thermal-break product criteria, specified on the default table, on which the default value is based. Placing the terms "Meets Thermal Break Default Criteria" on the default temporary label or default label certificate meets this requirement. 

2. Certification to NFRC Rating Procedure. If a prod-II uct's U-factor, SHGC or VT is based on the NFRC Rat­ing Procedure, the U-factor, SHGC or VT shall be certified by the manufacturer according to the proce­dures of an independent certifying organization approved by the Commission. 
A. A temporary label, affixed to the product or label certificate for CMA and site-built fenestration, II meeting the requirements ofSection 10-lll(a) certi­fied by the independent certifying organization complies with this requirement. 
B. An "independent certifying organization approved by the Commission" means any organization autho­rized by the supervisory entity to certify U-factor ratings, Solar Heat Gain Coefficient and Visible 
II 

Transmittance ratings in accordance with the NFRC Rating Procedure. Ifthe Commission designates the NFRC as the supervisory entity, any independent certification and Inspection Agency (lA) licensed by NFRC shall be deemed to be an "independent certi­fying organization approved by the Commission." 
C. The "supervisory entity" means the National Fenes­tration Rating Council (NFRC), except as provided II in Section 10-111 (c) 1. 
Exception to Section 10-111(b): Field-fabricated fenestration products. 

(c) Designation ofsupervisory entity. The National Fenes­
tration Rating Council shall be the supervisory entity to admin­ister the certification program relating to U-factors, SHGC, and VT ratings for fenestration products, provided the Commission determines that the NFRC meets the criteria in Section 10-111(d). 
1. 	
The Commission may consider designating a supervi­sory entity other than NFRC only if the Commission detem1ines that the NFRC cannot meet the criteria in Section 10-111 (d). Such other supervisory entity shall II meet the criteria in Section 10-111 (d) prior to being designated. 

2. 	
The Commission shall periodically review, at least annually, the structure and operations of the supervi­sory entity to ensure continuing compliance with the II criteria in Section 10-111 (d). 


(d) Criteria for supervisory entity. 
1. 	Membership in the entity shall be open on a nondis­criminatory basis to any person or organization that has an interest in uniform thermal performance ratings for fenestration products, including, but not limited to, members of the fenestration industry, glazing infill industry, building industry, design professionals, speci­fiers, utilities, government agencies and public interest organizations.

II The Board may consider applications for alternate means of compliance based on the relevance and appropriateness of the proposed alternative, the applicant's history of compli­ance/noncompliance with regulations, the completeness of the information provided in the application, the experiences of the jurisdiction during the pilot project, if applicable, and staff rec­ommendations. 
II Within 10 working days of receipt of the application, Board staff shall notify the applicant, in writing, that the application is complete and accepted for filing, or that the application is being returned as deficient and identifying what specific additional 
II information is needed. This does not preclude the Board mem­bers from requesting additional information necessary to make
