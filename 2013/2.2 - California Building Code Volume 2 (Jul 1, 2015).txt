PREFACE 
This document is Part 2 of 12 parts of the official triennial compilation and publication of the adoptions, amendments 
and repeal of administrative regulations to California Code of Regulations, Title 24, also referred to as the California 
Building Standards Code. This part is known as the California Building Code. 
The California Building Standards Code is published in its entirety every three years by order of the California legislature, with supplements published in intervening years. The California legislature delegated authority to various state agencies, boards, commissions and departments to create building regulations to implement the state's statutes. These building reg­ulations, or standards, have the same force of law, and take effect 180 days after their publication unless otherwise stipu­lated. The California Building Standards Code applies to occupancies in the State of California as annotated. 
A city, county, or city and county may establish more restrictive building standards reasonably necessary because of local climatic, geological or topographical conditions. Findings of the local condition(s) and the adopted local building standard(s) must be filed with the California Building Standards Commission to become effective and may not be effec­tive sooner than the effective date of this edition of the California Building Standards Code. Local building standards that were adopted and applicable to previous editions of the California Building Standards Code do not apply to this edition without appropriate adoption and the required filing.

EFFECTIVE USE OF THE IBC/CBC 

Distilling the code review process down to a methodical, sequential list of considerations is generally problematic. In many cases, related provisions from various chapters of the code must be considered simultaneously, or reconsidered later in the process to arrive at the correct classification or determination. Any number of acceptable alternatives may exist for construction of the building and its specific features. Each choice provided by the code must be evaluated for its specific impact on other aspects of the build­ing's analysis. With a basic understanding of the interrelationship of the various chapters, the practiced code user will make an initial assessment of the building as a first step of the code review process. The following outline may be helpful as a guide for the effective 
use of the IBC, with the understanding that final resolution of each step is often dependant on subsequent steps. 
The following process begins with a brief discussion of the key administrative areas of the code. The process addressing techni­cal provisions is divided into two distinct areas of analysis, the nonstructural provisions of the IBC and the structural provisions. Although reference is not made to all provisions set forth in the IBC, the process is intended to be representative of an approach to using the IBC in an effective manner. 
Administrative Provisions 
Prior to any analysis based on the technical provisions of the 
IBC, it is important that the fundamental administrative aspects of the code be reviewed. It is critical that the basis of technical decisions be consistent with the approach established in IBC Chapter 1, including: 
• 
Scope of the IBC 

• 
Intent of the IBC 

• 
Applicability of the IBC 


1. Classify the building for occupancy and construction type. The first step in analyzing a building for code compliance is its proper classification based on anticipated use(s) and construction features. 
Identify the distinct and varied uses of the building. 
The uses that will occur within the building must be identified, evaluated and classified into one or more of the distinct occupancy classifications established in the IBC. Some buildings will be classified as sin­gle-occupancy, where there is only one applicable occupancy classification. Others will be considered as mixed-occupancy due to the presence of two or more uses that are classified into different occupancy groups. 
Sec. 302.1 Classify the building into one or more occupancy groups. Although there are 10 general occupancy groups, many of the groups are subdivided into sub-groups to allow for a more exacting analysis of the building under consideration. 






Sec. 303 Group A 
Sec. 304 Group B 

Sec. 305 Group E 

Sec. 306 Group F 
Sec. 307 Group H 

Sec. 308 Group I 
Sec. 309 Group M 

Sec. 310 Group R 
Sec. 311 Group S 

Sec. 312 Group U 
Identify the building's type of construction based on the materials of construction and degree of fire-resistance for the building's major elements. The primary structural frame, exterior walls, interior walls, floor construction and roof construc­tion, as applicable, must be evaluated in regard to their degree of fire-resistance and materials of construction in order to classify the building based upon type of construction. 
2013 CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE EFFECTIVE USE OF THE IBC/CBC 






Table 601 
Sec. 603 Combustible materials in Type I and II buildings 


Sec. 1505 Verify classification of roof covering. Roof coverings are typically required to provide protection against moderate 
or light fire exposures from the exterior. Their minimum required classification is based upon the type of construction of the 
building. 

2. Determine if the building is to be fully sprinklered. Many of the code provisions vary based upon the presence of an automatic sprinkler system throughout, or in specific portions of, the building. 
Sec. 903.2 Determine if the building requires a tire sprinkler system. Many of the mandates for the installation of a sprin­
kler system are based upon the occupancy or occupancies that occur within the building. The provisions will often require some 
degree of occupant load and fire area determination. Other conditions may also trigger a required sprinkler installation, such as 
building height or the lack of exterior openings. 


If a sprinkler system is not required, review for potential code modifications if a sprinkler system is installed. There are a 
significant number of benefits provided by the code if a sprinkler system is installed. An initial analysis of the building will typi­
cally allow for an early determination of the value of such sprinkler benefits, including: 

Sec. 504.2 Story and height increase (reduced type of construction) 
Sec. 506.3 Allowable area increase (reduced type of construction) 
Sec. 507.3 Unlimited area building (reduced type of construction) 
Sec. 1018.1 Elimination of corridor fire-resistance rating 
3. Locate the building on the site. The location of the building(s) on the lot is fundamental to the degree of fire exposure to and from adjoining buildings and lots. In addition, the building's location influences the amount of fire department access that can be provided from the exterior of the building. 
(\)
"---­
Sec. 503.1.2 Determine the number of buildings on the site. Where two or more buildings are located on the same lot, they can 
be evaluated as a single building or multiple buildings. The type of construction requirements may differ based upon which of 

the two methods is utilized. 
Sec. 602.1 Determine minimum required tire rating of exterior walls. The fire separation distance is the measurement used 
in evaluating the necessary fire rating for exterior walls. It is measured from the building to the lot line, to the center line of a pub­

Sec. 602.1 Classify the buDding into a single type of construction. Five general types of construction have been established and further subdivided into nine specific construction types. The classification of construction type is based on a combination of the degree of frre-resistance and the type of materials of the key building elements. 
Sec. 602 TYPe of construction based on materials of construction 



lic way, or to an imaginary assumed line between two buildings on the same lot. Projections and parapets, if applicable, are also regulated. 

Sec. 704.8 Determine exterior opening protection requirements. Openings in exterior walls are regulated by the fire separa­tion distance and the rating of the exterior wall in which they are located. 


Sec. 506.2 Determine frontage increase for allowable area purposes. Utilized primarily for fire department access, open 
space adjacent to a building's perimeter provides for an increase in the allowable area. 

4. Verify building's construction type by determining the allowable building size. The permitted types of construction are pri­
()
marily based upon the occupancy classifications involved, the building's height and the building's floor area. Other conditions may also affect the appropriate construction types, including the building's location on the lot and the intended materials of construction. In buildings with mixed-occupancy conditions, the methods of addressing the relationship between the multiple occupancies indi­rectly affect construction type. 
Sec. 202 and 502 Calculate actual height of building in both 'feet' and 'stories above grade plane'. The code specifically 
describes the method for assigning a building height, measure both in the number of feet and the number of stories above grade 
plane. The actual height must be compared with the allowable height to determine if the building's type of construction is accept­
able. 

Sec. 504 Determine allowable height permitted for 'feet' and 'stories' 
Sec. 505 Determine if mezzanine provisions are applicable 
Sec. 504.3 Determine if any rooftop structures are in compliance 
Sec. 502 Calculate actual floor area of each story of building. The building area is typically the entire floor area that occurs 
within the surrounding exterior walls. The building area for each individual story must be calculated, as well as for the building 
as a whole.

Sec. 509 Determine if special provisions are to be applied for height and/or area. The general requirements for allowable height and area may be modified under limited conditions, typically where a parking garage is located in a building with other occupancies. 

5. Identify extent of any special detailed occupancy requirements. Special types of buildings, special uses that occur within buildings, and special elements of a building are further regulated through specific requirements found in Chapter 4. Since these provisions are specific in nature, they apply in lieu of the general requirements found elsewhere in the code. 
Chapter 4. Determine special detailed requirements based on occupancy. A number of the special provisions are applicable to 
a specific occupancy or group of similar occupancies.

6.Identify and evaluate fire and smoke protective elements. Where fire-resistance-rated construction and/or smoke protection is mandated by other provisions of the code, the provisions of Chapter 7 identify the appropriate methods for gaining compliance. Chapter 7. Verify compliance w/details of fire and smoke resistance. The various elements of fire-resistance-rated and 
smoke-resistant construction are detailed, including walls, horizontal assemblies, shaft enclosures, including openings such as doors and windows, as well as the penetration of such elements by conduit, ducts, piping and other items.

2013 CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE EFFECTIVE USE OF THE IBC/CBC 
7. Identify additional fire protection systems that may be required. In addition to automatic sprinkler systems, there are several other types of fire protection systems that may be required in a building. 
Sec. 907.2. Determine compliance with fire alarm provisions. Fire alarm systems are typically mandated based upon the occupancy classification and the number ?f occupants. 
Sec. 905.3. Determine if standpipe system is required. A standpipe system is required in buildings once a specified height is reached to provide for a more effective means of fighting a fue within the building. 
Sec. 905.4.6. Verify location of standpipe hose connections. 
8. Identify and evaluate materials utilized as interior floor, wall and ceiling finishes. Finish materials within the building are primarily regulated for flame spread and smoke development characteristics. 
Sec. 803.9. Verify compliance of wall and ceiling finishes. Interior wall and ceiling finishes are regulated based upon the occu­
pancy classification of the space and their location within the means of egress system. The classification may typically be 
reduced where sprinkler protection is provided. 
Sec. 804.4. Verify coJ,Dpliance of floor finishes. While regulated differently than wall and ceiling finishes, floor finishes com­prised of fibers are also controlled based upon their use in the egress system, the occupancy classification, and the presence of a sprinkler system. 
9. Evaluate means of egress system based on anticipated occupant loads. The expected occupant load is the basis for the design of the means of egress system. The egress elements must provide for a direct, continuous, obvious, undiminished and unobstructed path of travel from any occupiable point in the building to the public way. 
Sec. 1004. Determine the design occupantload. Although the primary use of an occupant load is in the design of the building's means of egress system, occupant load is also occasionally an important factor in occupancy classification, sprinkler system and fue alarm system requirements, and plumbing fixture counts. 
Chapter 10. Verify compliance with means of egress provisions. The means of egress system is intended to provide the primary occupant protection from fire and other hazards. The system consists of two major components, egress components and egress design.

Structural Provisions 
General Requirements 

1. Design Loads. 
The 2012 IBC references the national load standard, Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures (ASCE/SEI 

7-10) with Supplement Number 2. 





Determine the applicable design loads that the building structure is expected to be subjected to. Code prescribed loads are given in Chapter 16 and the referenced standard, ASCE/SEI 7. The code prescribed minimum live loads are given in IBC Table 1607.1. 
() 
The various code prescribed loads are probabilistic in nature. Environmental loads, such as flood, rain, snow, seismic and wind vary based on the location of the building site. The following table gives the IBC section and ASCEISEI 7 chapter for various types 
of load. 	· 





EFFECTIVE USE OF THE IBC/CBC 
2. Structural Materials. 
The structural design begins with the selection of the type of structural materials to be used to support the building. Structural fram­ing systems are constructed of concrete, masonry, steel or wood. Some miscellaneous or specialty structures and components, such as awnings, canopies and cladding, are often constructed of aluminum. 
The design of various structural materials is covered in specific material chapters in the code which in turn reference design stan­dards for the type of material involved. The referenced standards in the 2012 IBC for the structural materials are shown in the following table:

1. The above table shows the main structural design standards for these structural materials. fur a complete list of referenced standards, see me Chapter 35. 
3. Structural Analysis, Design and Detailing. 
Once the applicable loads are determined, the structural system of the building must be analyzed to determine the effects of the gov­erning gravity and lateral loads that act on the structure. The structural system of a typical building consists of the roof and floor sys­tems, walls, beams and columns, and the foundation. From the structural analysis, the next step is to design the structural members, elements and systems to provide the minimum level of resistance in accordance with the various load combinations prescribed in Section 1605. 
Once the structural elements and systems are designed, the next step is to detail the load transfer connections to provide a com­

plete load path from the point of origin to the resisting element. In general, the ultimate resisting element of buildings and structures is the foundation and supporting ground. The final step is to prepare a complete set of construction documents as required by Sec­tions 107 and 1603. Construction documents are defined in Section 202 as "Written, graphic and pictorial documents prepared or assembled for describing the design, location and physical characteristics of the elements of a project necessary for obtaining a building permit." In general, construction documents consist of plans, specifications and calculations. 
Section 1603.1 requires construction documents to show the size, section and relative locations of structural members with floor levels, column centers and offsets dimensioned. Design loads required by Sections 1603.1.1 through 1603.1.9 must be indicated on the construction documents. If complete construction documents consisting of plans, specifications and calculations are provided, the items listed in Sections1603.1.1 through 1603.9 are generally included.

The exception permits construction documents for buildings constructed in accordance with the conventional light-frame con­struction provisions of Section 2308 need only indicate the following: Floor and roof live loads Ground snow load, Pg. Basic (3-second gust) wind speed (mph) and wind exposure category. Seismic design category and site class. 
Flood design data where sited in flood hazard areas 
Design load-bearing values of soils. 


General Requirements 
1. Occupancy Category (mC/CBC Table 1604.5). 
Determine the occupancy category of the building based on Table 1604.5. 

Where a structure is occupied by two or more occupancies that are not the same occupancy category, the building must be classi­
fied in the highest occupancy category corresponding to the various occupancies. 
Where structures have two or more portions that are structurally separated, each separate portion should be separately classified. 
Where a separated portion of a structure provides required access or egress from another portion of the building with a higher 


Where a separated portion of a structure shares life safety components with another portion of the building with a higher occu­pancy category, both portions of the building must be assigned the higher occupancy category. 
2. Floor and roof live loads (mC/CBC Table 1607.1). 
Determine uniformly distributed and concentrated floor live load for the floor areas of the building in accordance with Section 1603.1.1 and Table 1607.1. () Floor live load reduction in accordance with Section 1607.9 should be indicated for each type of live load that is reduced. Determine the roof live load for roof areas in accordance with Section 1607.11. Roof live load reduction in accordance with Section 1607.11.2 should be indicated for roof live loads that are reduced. 
3. Snow load (mC/CBC Section 1608, ASCE/SEI 7 Section 7). 

Determine the ground snow load, 
P c• based on the location of the building site in accordance with Figure 1608.2 for the contigu­ous United States and Table 1608.2 for Alaska. 
In areas where the ground snow load, Pc, exceeds 10 psf, the following information should be determined:

How to Distinguish Between Model Code Language 


and California Amendments 
 To distinguish between model code language and the incorporated California amendments, including exclusive California stan­

) dards, California amendments will appear in italic font print. 
[BSC] This is an example of a state agency acronym used to identify an adoption or amendment by the agency. The acronyms will appear at California Amendments and in te Matrix Adoption Tables. Sections I.2 through I.I4 in Chapter I, Division I of this code, explain the used acronyms, the application of state agency adoptions to building occupancies or building features, the enforcement agency as designated by state law (may be the state adopting agency or local building or fire official), the authority in 





state law for the state agency to make the adoption, and the specific state law being implemented by the agency 's adoption. The fol­lowing acronyms are used in Title 24 to identify the state adopting agency making an adoption.

California Matrix Adoption Tables 


Format of the California Matrix Adoption Tables 
The matrix adoption tables, examples of which follow, are non-regulatory aids intended to show the user which state agencies have adopted and/or amended given sections of the model code. An agency's statutory authority for certain occupancies or building applications determines which chapter or section may be adopted, repealed, amended or added. See Chapter 1, Division I, Sections 
1.2 through 1.14 for agency authority, building applications and enforcement responsibilities. 
The side headings identify the scope of state agencies' adoption as follows: 



Adopt the entire IBC chapter without state amendments. 
If there is an "X" under a particular state agency's acronym on this row; this means that particular state agency has adopted the entire model code chapter without any state amendments.

structural members and their connections shall be determined by methods of . struc­tural analysis that take into account equilibrium, general sta­bility, geometric compatibility and both short-and long-term 
material properties. 



Members that tend to accumulate residual deformations under repeated service loads shall have included in their anal­ysis the added eccentricities expected to occur during their 
service life. 
Any system or method of construction to be used shall be based on a rational analysis in accordance with well-estab­lished principles of mechanics. Such analysis shall result in a system that provides a complete load path capable of transfer­ring loads from their point of origin to the load-resisting ele­ments. 
The total lateral force shall be distributed to the various vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting system in pro­portion to their rigidities, considering the rigidity of the hori­zontal bracing system or diaphragm. Rigid elements assumed 
not to be a part of the lateral force-resisting system are per­mitted to be incorporated into buildings provided their effect on the action of the system is considered and provided for in the design. Except where diaphragms are flexible, or are per­
mitted to be analyzed as flexible, provisions shall be made for the increased forces induced on resisting elements of the structural system resulting from torsion due to eccentricity between the center of application of the lateral forces and the center of rigidity of the lateral force-resisting system. 
Every structure shall be designed to resist the overturning effects caused by the lateral forces specified in this chapter. See Section 1609 for wind loads, Section 1610 for lateral soil loads and Section 1613 for earthquake loads.

Where a building or struc­ture is occupied by two or more occupancies not included in the same risk category, it shall be assigned the classifica­tion of the highest risk category corresponding to the vari­ous occupancies. Where buildings or structures have two or more portions that are structurally separated, each portion 
shall be separately classified. Where a separated portion of a building or structure provides required access to, required egress from or shares life safety components with another portion having a higher risk category, both portions shall be assigned to the higher risk category. 
1604.6 In-situ load tests. The building official is authorized to require an engineering analysis or a load test, or both, of any construction whenever there is reason to question the safety of the construction for the intended occupancy. Engi­neering analysis and load tests shall be conducted in accor­dance with Section 1709. 
1604.7 Preconstruction load tests. Materials and methods of construction that are not capable of being designed by approved engineering analysis or that do not comply with the applicable referenced standards, or alternative test procedures 
in accordance with Section 1707, shall be load tested in accordance with Section 1710. 
1604.8 Anchorage. Buildings and other structures, and por­tions thereof, shall be provided with anchorage in accordance with Sections 1604.8.1 through 1604.8.3, as applicable. 
1604.8.1 General. Anchorage of the roof to walls and col­umns, and of walls and columns to foundations, shall be provided to resist the uplift and sliding forces that result from the application of the prescribed loads. 
1604.8.2 Structural walls. Wails that provide vertical load-bearing resistance or lateral shear resistance for a portion of the structure shall be anchored to the roof and to all floors and members that provide lateral support for the wall or that are supported by the wall. The connections shall be capable of resisting the horizontal forces specified in Section 1.4.4 of ASCE 7 for walls of structures assigned to Seismic Design Category A and to Section 12.11 of ASCE 7 for walls of structures assigned to all other seis­mic design categories. Required anchors in masonry walls of hollow units or cavity walls shall be embedded in a reinforced grouted structural element of the wall. See Sec­tions 1609 for wind design requirements and 1613 for earthquake design requirements. 
1604.8.3 Decks. Where supported by attachment to an exterior wall, decks shall be positively anchored to the primary structure and designed for both vertical and lat­eral loads as applicable. Such attachment shall not be accomplished by the use of toenails or nails subject to withdrawal. Where positive connection to the primary building structure cannot be verified during inspection, docks shall be self-supporting. Connections of decks with cantilevered framing members to exterior walls or other framing members shall be designed for both of the follow­ing: 
1. 
The reactions resulting from the dead load and live load specified in Table 1607.1, or the snow load specified in Section 1608, in accordance with Sec­tion 1605, acting on all portions of the deck. 

2. 
The reactions resulting from the dead load and live load specified in Table 1607.1, or the snow load specified in Section 1608, in accordance with Sec­tion 1605, acting on the cantilevered portion of the deck, and no live load or snow load on the remaining portion of the deck.

Each portion of a roof shall be designed to sustain the load of rainwater that will accumulate on it if the primary drainage system for that portion is blocked plus the uniform load caused by water that rises above the inlet of the secondary drainage system at its design flow. The design rainfall shall be based on the 100-year hourly rainfall rate indicated in Figure 1611.1 or on other rainfall rates detennined from approved local weather data. 


R = 5.2(d, + dh) 	(Equation 16-36) 
For SI: R = 0.0098(d, + db) 
where: 
dh = 	Additional depth of water on the undeflected roof above the inlet of secondary drainage system at its design flow (i.e., the hydraulic head), in inches (mm). 
d, = 	Depth of water on the undeflected roof up to the inlet of secondary drainage system when the primary drainage system is blocked (i.e., the static head), in inches (mm). 
R = 	Rain load on the undeflected roof, in psf (k:N/m2). When the phrase "undeflected roof' is used, deflections from loads (including dead loads) shall not be considered when detennining the amount of rain on the roof. 
1611.2 Ponding instability. Susceptible bays of roofs shall be evaluated for ponding instability in accordance with Sec­tion 8.4 of ASCE 7. 
1611.3 Controlled drainage. Roofs equipped with hardware to control the rate of drainage shall be equipped with a sec­ondary drainage system at a higher elevation that limits accu­mulation of water on the roof above that elevation. Such roofs shall be designed to sustain the load of rainwater that will accumulate on them to the elevation of the secondary drain­age system plus the uniform load caused by water that rises above the inlet of the secondary drainage system at its design flow detennined from Section 1611.1. Such roofs shall also be checked for ponding instability in accordance with Section 161 1.2.

In 	each of the two orthogonal directions, the approximate fundamental period of the structure, Ta, in each of the two orthogonal directions deter­mined in accordance with Section 12.8.2.1 of ASCE 7, is less than 0.8 T, determined in accor­dance with Section 11.4.5 of ASCE 7. 

2. 
In each of the two orthogonal directions, the fun­damental period of the structure used to calculate the story drift is less than T,. 

3. 	
Equation 12.8-2 of ASCE 7 is used to determine the seismic response coefficient, C,. 

4. 
The diaphragms are rigid as defined in Section 


12.3.1 of ASCE 7 or, for diaphragms that are flexible, the distances between vertical elements of the seismic force-resisting system do not exceed 40 feet (12 192 mm). 
Exception: [OSHPD 2] Seismic design category shall be determined in accordance with exception to Section 1613.3.5.

1.2DEFINITIONS. 
BALLASTED PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEM: A roof mounted system composed of solar photovoltaic panels and supporting members that are unattached or par­tially attached to the roof and must rely on its weight, aerodynamics and friction to counter the effect of wind and seismic forces. 

1613.5.2 [BSC, HCD1& HCD2] Modify ASCE 7 Sec­
tion 13.4 as follows: 

Section 13.4 NONSTRUCTURAL COMPONENT ANCHORAGE. 
Components and their supports shall be attached (or anchored) to the structure in accordance with the requirements of this section and the attachment shall satisfy the requirements for the parent material as set forth elsewhere in this standard. Component attach­ments shall be bolted, welded, or otherwise positively fastened without consideration of frictional resistance produced by the effects of gravity. A continuous load path of sufficient strength and stiffness between the component and the supporting structure shall be pro­vided. Local elements of the structure including con­nections shall be designed and constructed for the component forces where they control the design of the elements or their connections. The component forces shall be those determined in Section 13.3.1, except that modifications to Fp and R, due to anchorage conditions need not be considered. The design documents shall include sufficient information relating to the attach­ments to verify compliance with the requirements of this section.

mined for the site at which the building or structure is to be 
constructed. Account shall be taken of variations in ground 
surface roughness that arise from natural topography 
and 
vegetation as well as from constructed features. 
1609A.4.1 Wind directions and sectors. For each selected wind direction at which the wind loads are to be evaluated, the exposure of the building or structure shall be determined for the two upwind sectors extending 45 degrees (0.79 rad) either side of the selected wind direc­tion. The exposures in these two sectors shall be deter­mined in accordance with Sections 1609A.4.2 and 1609A.4.3 and the exposure resulting in the highest wind loads shall be used to represent winds from that direction. 
1609A.4.2 Surface roughness categories. A ground sur­face roughness within each 45-degree (0.79 rad) sector shall be determined for a distance upwind of the site as defined in Section 1609A.4.3 from the categories defined below, for the purpose of assigning an exposure category as defined in Section 1609A.4.3. 

Surface Roughness B. Urban and suburban areas, wooded areas or other terrain with numerous closely spaced obstructions having the size of single-family dwellings or larger. 
Surface Roughness C. Open terrain with scattered obstructions having heights generally less than 30 feet (9 144 mm). This category includes flat open country, and grasslands. 
Surface Roughness D. Flat, unobstructed areas and water surfaces. This category includes smooth mud flats, salt flats and unbroken ice.

For buildings with a mean roof height of less than or equal to 30 feet (9144 mm), Exposure B shall apply where the ground surface roughness, as defmed by Surface Roughness B, prevails in the upwind direction for a distance of at least 1 ,500 feet ( 457 m). For buildings with a mean roof height greater 
than 30 feet (9144 mm), Exposure B shall apply where Surface Roughness B prevails in the upwind direction for a distance of at least 2,600 feet (792 m) or 20 times the height of the building, whichever is greater . 

.. 

Exposure C. Exposure C shall apply for all cases where Exposures B or D do not apply. 

Exposure D. Exposure D shall apply where the ground surface roughness, as defined by Surface Roughness D, prevails in the upwind direction for a distance of at least 5,000 feet (1524 m) or 20 times the height of the 


building, whichever is greater. Exposure D shall also apply where the ground surface roughness immediately upwind of the site is B or C, and the site is within a dis­tance of 600 feet (183 m) or 20 times the building height, whichever is greater, from an exposure D condi­tion as defined in the previous sentence.

1609A.5.2 Roof coverings. Roof coverings shall comply with Section 1609A.5.1. 
Exception: Rigid tile roof coverings that are air perme­able and installed over a roof deck complying with Sec­tion 1609A.5.1 are permitted to be designed in accordance with Section 1609A.5.3. 
Asphalt shingles installed over a roof deck complying with Section 1609A.5.1 shall comply with the wind-resis­tance requirements of Section 1507.2.7.1. 
1609A.5.3 Rigid tile. Wind loads on rigid tile roof cover­ings shall be determined in accordance with the following equation: 
(Equation 16A-34) 
For SI: Ma = 
where: 
b = 	Exposed width, feet (mm) of the roof tile. 
CL = 	Lift coefficient. The lift coefficient for concrete and clay tile shall be 0.2 or shall be determined by test in accordance with Section 171 1A.2. 
GCP=	Roof pressure coefficient for each applicable roof zone determined from Chapter 30 of ASCE 7. Roof coefficients shall not be adjusted for internal pressure.

STRUCTURAL DESIGN 
La = 	Moment arm, feet (mm) from the axis of rotation to the point of uplift on the roof tile. The point of uplift shall be taken at 0.76£ from the head of the tile and the middle of the exposed width. For roof tiles with nails or screws (with or without a tail clip), the axis of rotation shall be taken as the head of the tile for direct deck application or as the top edge of the batten for battened applications. For roof tiles fastened only by a nail or screw along the side of the tile, the axis of rotation shall be determined by testing.

1810.4 Installation. Deep foundations shall be installed in accordance with Section 1810.4. Where a single deep founda­tion element comprises two or more sections of different materials or different types spliced together, each section shall satisfy the applicable conditions of installation. 






SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS 
1810.4.1 Structural integrity. Deep foundation elements shall be installed in such a manner and sequence as to pre­vent distortion or damage that may adversely affect the structural integrity of adjacent structures or of foundation elements being installed or already in place and as to avoid compacting the surrounding soil to the extent that other foundation elements cannot be installed properly. 
1810.4.1.1 Compressive strength of precast concrete piles. A precast concrete pile shall not be driven before the concrete has attained a compressive strength of at least 75 percent of the specified compressive strength lf'c), but not less than the strength sufficient to withstand handling and driving forces. 
1810.4.1.2 Casing. Where cast-in-place deep founda­tion elements are formed through unstable soils and concrete is placed in an open-drilled hole, a casing shall be inserted in the hole prior to placing the concrete. Where the casing is withdrawn during concreting, the level of concrete shall be maintained above the bottom of the casing at a sufficient height to offset any hydro­static or lateral soil pressure. Driven casings shall be mandrel driven their full length in contact with the sur­rounding soil. 
1810.4.1.3 Driving near uncased concrete. Deep foundation elements shall not be driven within six ele­ment diameters center to center in granular soils or within one-half the element length in cohesive soils of an uncased element filled with concrete less than 48 hours old unless approved by the building official. If the concrete surface in any completed element rises or drops, the element shall be replaced. Driven uncased deep foundation elements shall not be installed in soils that could cause heave. 
1810.4.1.4 Driving near cased concrete. Deep foun­dation elements shall not be driven within four and one­half average diameters of a cased element filled with concrete less than 24 hours old unless approved by the building official. Concrete shall not be placed in cas­ings within heave range of driving. 
1810.4.1.5 Defective timber piles. Any substantial sudden increase in rate of penetration of a timber pile shall be investigated for possible damage. If the sudden increase in rate of penetration cannot be correlated to soil strata, the pile shall be removed for inspection or rejected. 
1810.4.2 Identification. Deep foundation materials shall be identified for conformity to the specified grade with this identity maintained continuously from the point of manufacture to the point of installation or shall be tested by an approved agency to determine conformity to the specified grade. The approved agency shall furnish an affi­davit of compliance to the building official. 
1810.4.3 Location plan. A plan showing the location and designation of deep foundation elements by an identifica­tion system shall be filed with the building official prior to installation of such elements. Detailed records for ele­ments shall bear an identification corresponding to that shown on the plan.

1810.4.4 Preexcavation. The use of jetting, augering or other methods of preexcavation shall be subject to the approval of the building official. Where permitted, preex­cavation shall be carried out in the same manner as used for deep foundation elements subject to load tests and in such a manner that will not impair the carrying capacity of the elements already in place or damage adjacent struc­tures. Element tips shall be driven below the preexcavated depth until the required resistance or penetration is obtained. 
1810.4.5 Vibratory driving. Vibratory drivers shall only be used to install deep foundation elements where the ele­ment load capacity is verified by load tests in accordance with Section 1810.3.3.1.2. The installation of production elements shall be controlled according to power consump­tion, rate of penetration or other approved means that ensure element capacities equal or exceed those of the test elements. 
1810.4.6 Heaved elements. Deep foundation elements that have heaved during the driving of adjacent elements shall be redriven as necessary to develop the required capacity and penetration, or the capacity of the element shall be verified by load tests in accordance with Section 1810.3.3. 1.2. 
1810.4.7 Enlarged base cast-in-place elements. 
Enlarged bases for cast-in-place deep foundation elements formed by compacting concrete or by driving a precast base shall be formed in or driven into granular soils. Such elements shall be constructed in the same manner as suc­cessful prototype test elements driven for the project. Shafts extending through peat or other organic soil shall be encased in a permanent steel casing. Where a cased shaft is used, the shaft shall be adequately reinforced to resist column action or the annular space around the shaft shall be filled sufficiently to reestablish lateral support by the soil. Where heave occurs, the element shall be replaced unless it is demonstrated that the element is undamaged and capable of carrying twice its design load. 
1810.4.8 Hollow-stem augered, cast-in-place elements. 
Where concrete or grout is placed by pumping through a 
hollow-stem auger, the auger shall be permitted to rotate in a clockwise direction during withdrawal. As the auger is withdrawn at a steady rate or in increments not to exceed 1 foot (305 mm), concreting or grouting pumping pressures shall be measured and maintained high enough at all times to offset hydrostatic and lateral earth pressures. Concrete or grout volumes shall be measured to ensure that the vol­ume of concrete or grout placed in each element is equal to or greater than the theoretical volume of the hole created by the auger. Where the installation process of any ele­ment is interrupted or a loss of concreting or grouting pressure occurs, the element shall be redrilled to 5 feet (1524 mm) below the elevation of the tip of the auger when the installation was interrupted or concrete or grout pressure was lost and reformed. Augered cast-in-place ele­ments shall not be installed within six diameters center to center of an element filled with concrete or grout less than 12 hours old, unless approved by the building official. If the concrete or grout level in any completed element drops due to installation of an adjacent element, the element shall be replaced. 


1810.4.9 Socketed drilled shafts. The rock socket and pipe or tube casing of socketed drilled shafts shall be thor­oughly cleaned of foreign materials before filling with concrete. Steel cores shall be bedded in cement grout at the base of the rock socket. 
1810.4.10 Micropiles. Micropile deep foundation ele­ments shall be permitted to be formed in holes advanced by rotary or percussive drilling methods, with or without casing. The elements shall be grouted with a fluid cement grout. The grout shall be pumped through a tremie pipe extending to the bottom of the element until grout of suit­able quality returns at the top of the element. The follow­ing requirements apply to specific installation methods: 
1. 
For micropiles grouted inside 	a temporary casing, the reinforcing bars shall be inserted prior to with­drawal of the casing. The casing shall be withdrawn in a controlled manner with the grout level main­tained at the top of the element to ensure that the grout completely fills the drill hole. During with­drawal of the casing, the grout level inside the cas­ing shall be monitored to verify that the flow of grout inside the casing is not obstructed. 


2. 
For a micropile or portion thereof grouted in an open drill hole in soil without temporary casing, the mini­mum design diameter of the drill hole shall be veri­fied by a suitable device during grouting. 

3. 	
For micropiles designed for end bearing, a suitable means shall be employed to verify that the bearing surface is properly cleaned prior to grouting. 

4. 	
Subsequent micropiles shall not be drilled near ele­ments that have been grouted until the grout has had sufficient time to harden. 

5. 	
Micro piles shall be grouted as soon as possible after drilling is completed. 

6. 	
For micropiles designed with a full-length casing, the casing shall be pulled back to the top of the bond zone and reinserted or some other suitable means employed to assure grout coverage outside the cas­ing. 


1810.4.11 Helical piles. Helical piles shall be installed to specified embedment depth and torsional resistance crite­ria as determined by a registered design professional. The torque applied during installation shall not exceed the maximum allowable installation torque of the helical pile. 
1810.4.12 Special inspection. Special inspections in accordance with Sections 1705.7 and 1705.8 shall be pro­vided for driven and cast-in-place deep foundation ele­ments, respectively. 
Special inspections in accordance with Section 1705.9 shall be provided for helical piles.

group and the soil contained within a block 
defined by the perimeter of the group and the 
length of the element, plus two-thirds of the 
ultimate shear resistance along the soil block.

Such elements shall be constructed in the same manner as suc­cessful prototype test elements driven for the project. Shafts extending through peat or other organic soil shall be encased in a permanent steel casing. Where a cased shaft is used, the shaft shall be adequately reinforced to resist column action or the annular space around the shaft shall be filled sufficiently to reestablish lateral support by the soil. Where heave occurs, the element shall be replaced unless it is demonstrated that the element is undamaged and capable of carrying twice its design load. 

1810A.4.8 Hollow-stem angered, cast-in-place ele­ments. Where concrete or grout is placed by pumping through a hollow-stem auger, the auger shall be permitted to rotate in a clockwise direction during withdrawal. As the auger is withdrawn at a steady rate or in increments not to exceed 1 foot (305 mm), concreting or grouting pump­ing pressures shall be measured and maintained high enough at all times to offset hydrostatic and lateral earth pressures. Concrete or grout volumes shall be measured to ensure that the volume of concrete or grout placed in each element is equal to or greater than the theoretical volume of the hole created by the auger. Where the installation process of any element is interrupted or a loss of concret­ing or grouting pressure occurs, the element shall be redrilled to 5 feet (1524 mm) below the elevation of the tip of the auger when the installation was interrupted or con­crete or grout pressure was lost and reformed. Augered cast-in-place elements shall not be installed within six diameters center to center of an element filled with con­crete or grout less than 12 hours old, unless approved by the building official. If the concrete or grout level in any completed element drops due to installation of an adjacent element, the element shall be replaced.

by rotary or percussive drilling methods, with or without 
casing. The elements shall be grouted with a fluid cement 
grout. The grout shall be pumped through a tremie pipe 
extending to the bottom of the element until grout of suit­
able quality returns at the top of the element. The follow­
ing requirements apply to specific installation methods: 

1. For micropiles grouted inside 	a temporary casing, 
the reinforcing bars shall be inserted prior to with­
drawal of the casing. The casing shall be withdrawn 
in a controlled manner with the grout level main­
tained at the top of the element to ensure that the 
grout completely fills the drill hole. During with­
drawal of the casing, the grout level inside the cas­

(J

quake loads or effects. The bearing area of headed anchors shall be not less than one and one-half times the shank area. Where strength design is used, or where load combinations include earthquake loads or effects, the design strength of anchors shall be determined in accordance with Section 1909A. Bolts shall conform to ASTM A 307 or an approved equivalent. 
1908A.l.l Power actuated fasteners. Power actuated fas­teners qualified in accordance with ICC-ES AC 70 shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this section. 
Power actuated fasteners shall be permitted in seismic shear for components exempt from permit requirements by Section 1616A.l.J8 of this code and for interior nonbear­ing non-shear wall partitions. Power actuated fastener shall not be used to anchor exterior cladding or curtain wall systems. 
1908A.2 Allowable service load. The allowable service load for headed anchors in shear or tension shall be as indicated in Table 1908A.2. Where anchors are subject to combined shear and tension, the following relationship shall be satisfied: 
(P, I Pt i'3 + (V, I Vt ) 513  1 (Equation 19A-1) 
where: 

P, = Applied tension service load, pounds (N). 
Pt = Allowable tension service load from Table 1908A.2, 

pounds (N). V, = Applied shear service load, pounds (N). Vt = Allowable shear service load from Table 1908A.2, 
pounds (N). 1908A.3 Required edge distance and spacing. The allow­able service loads in tension and shear specified in Table 1908A.2 are for the edge distance and spacing specified. The edge distance and spacing are permitted to be reduced to SO percent of the values specified with an equal reduction in allowable service load. Where edge distance and spacing are reduced less than SO percent, the allowable service load shall be determined by linear interpolation. 
1908A.4 Increase in allowable load. Increase of the values in Table 1908A.2 by one-third is permitted where the provi­sions of Section 160SA.3.2 permit an increase in allowable stress for wind loading. 
1908A.5 Increase for special -inspection. Where special inspection is provided for the installation of anchors, a 100­percent increase in the allowable tension values of Table 
1908A.2 is permitted. No increase in shear value is permitted.

2308.9.7 Openings in interior nonbearing partitions. 
Openings in nonbearing partitions are permitted to be framed with single studs and headers. Each end of a lintel or header shall have a length of bearing of not less than 1 1I2 inches (38 mm.) for the full width of the lintel. 
2308.9.8 Pipes in walls. Stud partitions containing plumb­ing, heating or other pipes shall be so framed and the joists underneath so spaced as to give proper clearance for the piping. Where a partition containing such piping runs par­allel to the floor joists, the joists underneath such parti­tions shall be doubled and spaced to permit the passage of such pipes and shall be bridged. Where plumbing, heating or other pipes are placed in or partly in a partition, necessi­tating the cutting of the soles or plates, a metal tie not less than 0.058 inch (1.47 mm) (16 galvanized gage) and 1 1/2 inches (38 mm) wide shall be fastened to each plate across and to each side of the opening with not less than six 16d nails. 



2308.9.9 Bridging. Unless covered by interior or exterior wall coverings or sheathing meeting the minimum require­ments of this code, stud partitions or walls with studs hav­ing a height-to-least-thickness ratio exceeding 50 shall have bridging not less than 2 inches (5 1 mm) in thickness and of the same width as the studs fitted snugly and nailed thereto to provide adequate lateral support. Bridging shall be placed in every stud cavity and at a frequency such that no stud so braced shall have a height-to-least-thickness ratio exceeding 50 with the height of the stud measured between horizontal framing and bridging or between bridging, whichever is greater. 
2308.9.10 Cutting and notching. In exterior walls and bearing partitions, any wood stud is permitted to be cut or notched to a depth not exceeding 25 percent of its width. Cutting or notching of studs to a depth not greater than 40 percent of the width of the stud is permitted in nonbearing partitions supporting no loads other than the weight of the partition.

a. 
The uplift connection requirements are based on a 30-foot mean roof height located in Exposure B. For Exposure CorD and for other mean roof heights, multiply the above loads by the adjustment coefficients below. 

b. 
The uplift connection requirements are based on the framing being spaced 24 inches on center. Multiply by 0.67 for framing spaced 16 inches on center and multiply by 0.5 for framing spaced 12 inches on center. 

c. 
The uplift connection requirements include an allowance for 10 pounds of dead load. 

() 
d. 
The uplift connection requirements do not account for the effects of overhangs. The magnitude of the above loads shall be increased by adding the overhang loads found in the table. The overhang loads are also based on framing spaced 24 inches on center. The overhang loads given shall be multiplied by the overhang projection and added to the roof uplift value in the table. 

e. 	
The uplift connection requirements are based upon wind loading on end zones as defined in Figure 28.6.3 of ASCE 7. Connection loads for connections located a distance of 20 percent of the least horizontal dimension of the building from the comer of the building are permitted to be reduced by multiplying the table connection value by 0.7 and multiplying the overhang load by 0.8. 

f. 
For wall-to-wall and wall-to-foundation connections, the capacity of the uplift connector is permitted to be reduced by 100 pounds for each full wall above. (For example, if a 500-pound rated connector is used on the roof framing, a 400-pound rated connector is permitted at the next floor level down). 

g. 
Interpolation is permitted for intermediate values of Vasd and roof spans. 


h. 
The rated capacity of approved tie-down devices is permitted to include up to a 60-percent increase for wind effects where allowed by material specifications. 

i. 	
Vasd shall be determined in accordance with Section 1609.3.1. 












2308.9.11 Bored holes. A hole not greater in diameter than 40.percent of the stud width is permitted to be bored in any wood stud. Bored holes not greater than 60 percent of the width of the stud are permitted in nonbearing parti­tions or in any wall where each bored stud is doubled, pro­vided not more than two such successive doubled studs are so bored. 
In no case shall the edge of the bored hole be nearer than 5/8 inch (15.9 mm) to the edge of the stud. 
Bored holes shall not be located at the same section of stud as a cut or notch. 
2308.10 Roof and ceiling framing. The framing details required in this section apply to roofs having a minimum slope of three units vertical in 12 units horizontal (25-percent slope) or greater. Where the roof slope is less than three units vertical in 12 units horizontal (25-percent slope), members supporting rafters and ceiling joists such as ridge board, hips and valleys shall be designed as beams. 
2308.10.1 Wind uplift. The roof construction shall have rafter and truss ties to the wall below. Resultant uplift 
2013 CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE 

loads shall be transferred to the foundation using a contin­uous load path. The rafter or truss to wall connection shall comply with Tables 2304.9.1 and 2308.10.1. 
2308.10.2 Ceiling joist spans. Allowable spans for ceiling joists shall be in accordance with Table 2308.10.2(1) or 2308.10.2(2). For other grades and species, refer to the 
AF &PA Span Tables for Joists and Rafters. 

2308.10.3 Rafter spans. Allowable spans for rafters shall be in accordance with Table 2308.10.3(1), 2308.10.3(2), 2308.10.3(3), 2308.10.3(4), 2308.10.3(5) or 2308.10.3(6). For other grades and species, refer to the AF &PA Span Tables for Joists and Rafters. 
2308.10.4 Ceiling joist and rafter framing. Rafters shall be framed directly opposite each other at the ridge. There shall be a ridge board at least l-inch (25 mm) nominal thickness at ridges and not less in depth than the cut end of the rafter. At valleys and hips, there shall be a single val­ley or hip rafter not less than 2-inch (5 1 mm) nominal thickness and not less in depth than the cut end of the raf­ter.

Ceiling joists and rafters shall be nailed to each other and the assembly shall be nailed to the top wall plate in accordance with Tables 2304.9.1 and 2308.10.1. Ceil­ing joists shall be continuous or securely joined where they meet over interior partitions and fastened to adja­cent rafters in accordance with Tables 2308.10.4.1 and 2304.9.1 to provide a continuous rafter tie across the 


·building where such joists are parallel to the rafters. Ceiling joists shall have a bearing surface of not less than 1 1/2 inches (38 mm) on the top plate at each end. 
Where ceiling joists are not parallel to rafters, an equivalent rafter tie shall be installed in a manner to provide a continuous tie across the building, at a spac­

() ing of not more than 4 feet (1219 mm) o.c. The connec­tions shall be in accordance with Tables 2308.10.4.1 and 2304.9.1, or connections of equivalent capacities shall be provided. Where ceiling joists or rafter ties are not provided at the top of the rafter support walls, the ridge formed by these rafters shall also be supported by a girder conforming to Section 2308.4. Rafter ties shall be spaced not more than 4 feet (1219 mm) o.c. Rafter tie connections shall be based on the equivalent rafter spacing in Table 2308.10.4.1. Where rafter ties are spaced at 32 inches (813 mm) o.c., the number of 16d common nails shall be two times the number specified for rafters spaced 16 inches (406 mm) o.c., with a minimum of four 16d common nails where no snow loads are indicated. Where rafter ties are
() spaced at 48 inches (1219 mm) o.c., the number of 16d common nails shall be two times the number specified for rafters spaced 24 inches (610 mm) o.c., with a mini­mum of six 16d common nails where no snow loads are indicated. Rafter/ceiling joist connections and rafter/tie connections shall be of sufficient size and number to prevent splitting fi:om nailing. 2308.10.4.2 Notches and holes. Notching at the ends of rafters or ceiling joists shall not exceed one-fourth the depth. Notches in the top or bottom of the rafter or ceiling joist shall not exceed one-sixth the depth and shall not be located in the middle one-third of the span, except that a notch not exceeding one-third of the depth is permitted in the top of the rafter or ceiling joist not further from the face of the support than the depth of the member. Holes bored in rafters or ceiling joists shall not be within 2 inches (5 1 mm) of the top and bottom and their diameter shall not exceed one-third the depth of the member. 2308.10.4.3 Framing around openings. Trimmer and header rafters shall be doubled, or of lumber of equiva­lent cross section, where the span of the header exceeds 4 feet (1219 mm). The ends of header rafters more than 6 feet (1 829 mm) long shall be supported by framing anchors or rafter hangers unless bearing on a beam, partition or wall. 




WOOD 
2308.10.5 Purlins. Purlins to support roof loads are per­mitted to be installed to reduce the span of rafters within allowable limits and shall be supported by struts to bearing walls. The maximum span of 2-inch by 4-inch (51 mm by 102 mm) purlins shall be 4 feet (1219 mm). The maximum span of the 2-inch by 6-inch (5 1 mm by 152 mm) purlin shall be 6 feet (1829 mm), but in no case shall the purlin be smaller than the supported rafter. Struts shall not be smaller than 2-inch by 4-inch (5 1 mm by 102 mm) mem­bers. The unbraced length of struts shall not exceed 8 feet (2438 mm) and the minimum slope of the struts shall not be less than 45 degrees (0.79 rad) from the horizontal. 
2308.10.6 Blocking. Roof rafters and ceiling joists shall be supported laterally to prevent rotation and lateral dis­placement in accordance with the provisions of Section 2308.8.5. 
2308.10.7 Engineered wood products. Prefabricated wood 1-joists, structural glued-laminated timber and struc­tural composite lumber shall not be notched or drilled except where permitted by the manufacturer's recommen­dations or where the effects of such alterations are specifi­

cally considered in the design of the member by a registered design professional. 
2308.10.8 Roof sheathing. Roof sheathing shall be in accordance with Tables 2304.7(3) and 2304.7(5) for wood structural panels, and Tables 2304.7(1) and 2304.7(2) for lumber and shall comply with Section 2304.7.2. 
2308.10.8.1 Joints. Joints in lumber sheathing shall occur over supports unless approved end-matched lum­ber is used, in which case each piece shall bear on at least two supports. 
2308.10.9 Roof planking. Planking shall be designed in accordance with the general provisions of this code. 
In lieu of such design, 2-inch (5 1 mm) tongue-and­groove planking is permitted in accordance with Table 2308.10.9. Joints in such planking are permitted to be ran­domly spaced, provided the system is applied to not less than three continuous spans, planks are center matched and end matched or splined, each plank bears on at least one support, and joints are separated by at least 24 inches (610 mm) in adjacent pieces. 
2308.10.10 Wood trusses. Wood trusses shall be designed in accordance with Section 2303.4.

CHAPTER 31 F [SLC] 
MARINE OIL TERMINALS 

Division I 


SECTION 3101F [SLC] INTRODUCTION 
3101F.1 General. The Lempert-Keene-Seastrand oil spill pre­vention and response act of 1990 (act), as amended, authorized the California State Lands Commission (SLC) to regulate marine oil terminals (MOTs) in order to protect public health, safety and the environment. The authority for this regulation is contained in Sections 8755 and 8756 of the California Public Resources Code. This act defines "oil" as any kind of petro­leum, liquid hydrocarbons, or petroleum products or any .frac­tion or residues thereof, including but not limited to, crude oil, bunker fuel, gasoline, diesel .fuel, aviation .fuel, oil sludge, oil refuse, oil mixed with waste, and liquid distillates from unpro­cessed natural gas. The provisions of this chapter regulate marine oil terminals as defined under this act. 
3101F.2 Purpose. The purpose of this code is to establish mini­mum engineering, inspection and maintenance criteria for MOTs in order to prevent oil spills and to protect public health, safety and the environment. This code does not, in general, address operational requirements. Relevant provisions from existing codes, industry standards, recommended practices, regulations and guidelines have been incorporated directly or through reference, as part of this code. 
Where there are differing requirements between this code and/or references cited herein, the choice of application shall be subject to approval of the Marine Facilities Division (Divi­sion) of the SLC. 
> 
3101 F.3 Applicability. The provisions of this chapter are appli­cable to the evaluation of existing MOTs and design of new MOTs in California. Each provision is classified as New (N), Existing (E), or Both (NIE) and shall be applied accordingly. if no classification is indicated, the classification shall be consid­ered to be (NIE). 
Existing (E) requirements apply to MOTs that are in opera­tion on the date this code is adopted. For these MOTs, equiva­lent or in-kind replacement of existing equipment, short pipeline sections, or minor modification of existing compo­nents shall also be subject to the existing (E) requirements. 
New (N) requirements apply to: 
1. 	
A MOT or berthing system (Subsection 3102F.1.3) that commences or recommences operation with a new or modified operations manual after adoption of this code. 

2. 	
Addition of new structural components or systems at an existing MOT that are structurally independent of exist­ing components or systems. 

3. 
Addition of new (nonreplacement) equipment, piping, pipelines, components or systems to an existing MOT. 

4. 	
Major repairs or substantially modified in-place systems. 

5. 
Any associated major installations or modifications. 


3101F.4 Overview. This Code ensures that a MOT can be safely operated within its inherent structural and equipment-related constraints. 
Section 3102F defines minimum requirements for audit, inspection and evaluation of the structural, electrical and mechanical systems on a prescribed periodic basis, or follow­ing a significant, potentially damage-causing event. 

Section 3 103F, 3104F and 3 107F provide criteria for structural loading, deformation and performance-based evaluation consider­ing earthquake, wind, wave, current, seiche and tsunami tffects. 
Section 3105F provides requirements for the safe mooring and berthing of tank vessels and barges. 
Section 3106F describes requirements for geotechnical haz­ards and .foundation analyses, including consideration of slope stability and soil .failure. 
Section 31 08F provides requirements .forfire prevention, detec­tion and suppression including appropriate water and .foam vol­umes. 
Sections 31 09F through 3111 F provide requirements for piping! I I pipelines, mechanical andelectrical equipment and electrical systems. 
English units are prescribed herein; however, many of the units in the references are in System International (Sf). 
3101F.S Risk reduction strategies. Risk reduction strategies, such as pipeline segmentation devices, system flexibility and spill containment devices may be used to reduce the size of a potential oil spill. Such strategies may reduce the MOT risk classification as determined from Table 31 F-4-1. 

3101F.6 Review requirements. 
3101F.6.1 Quality assurance. All audits, inspections, engi­neering analyses or design shall be reviewed by a profes­sional having similar or higher qualifications as the person who performed the work, to ensure quality assurance. This review may be performed in-house. 
Peer review is required for nonlinear dynamic structural analyses and alternative lateral force procedures not pre­scribed herein. The peer review may be from an independent internal or external source. The peer reviewer shall be a California registered civil or structural engineer. 
3101F.6.2 Division review. The following will be subject to review for compliance with this code by the Division or its authorized representative( s): 
1. 
Any audit, inspection, analysis or evaluation of MOTs. 

2. 
Any significant change, modification or re-design of a structural, mooring, fire, piping/pipelines, mechanical or electrical system at an MOT, prior to use or reuse. 

3. 	
Engineering analysis and design for any new MOT prior to construction. Also see Section 3102F.3.3. 1. 

4. 	
Construction inspection team and the construction inspection report(s). 


3101F.7 Alternatives. In special circumstances where certain requirements of these standards cannot be met, altenzatives that provide an equal or better protection of the public health, safety and the environment shall be subject to Division Chief approval with concurrence of the Division 's lead engineer in responsible charge. 
Authority: Sections 8755 and 8757, Public Resources Code. Reference: Sections 8750, 8751, 8755 and 8757, Public Resources Code.

SECTION 3102F AUDIT AND INSPECTION 


3102F.l General. 
3102Rl.l Purpose. Section 3102F defines minimum require­ments for audit, inspection, and evaluation of the structura mechanical and electrical components and systems. 
3102R1.2 Audit and inspections types. The audit and inspections described in this Chapter (31F) and 2 CCR 2320 (a) and (b) [2.1] are: 
1. 
Annual inspection 

2. 
Audit 

3. 
Post-event inspection 


Each has a distinct purpose and is conducted either at a 

> 	defined interval (see Table 31F-2-1 and Section 3102F.3.3.2), as a result of a significant, potentially dam­age-causing event or a significant change in operations. In the time between audits and inspections, operators are expected to conduct periodic walk-down examinations of the Mar to detect potentially unsafe conditions. 

3102R1.3 Berthing systems. For the purpose of assigning structural ratings and documenting the condition of mechanical and electrical systems, an MOT shall be divided into independent "berthing systems." A berthing system consists of the wharf and supporting structure, mechanical and electrical components that serve the berth and pipeline systems as defined in Title 2 CCR §2560 and 256I(n). 
For example, a Mar consisting of wharves with three berths adjacent to the shoreline could contain three independent "berthing systems " ifthe piping does not route through adja­cent berths. Therefore, a significant defect that would restrict the operation of one berth would have no impact on the other two berths. Conversely, ifa T-head Pier, with multiple berths sharing a trestle that supports all piping to the shoreline, had a significant deficiency on the common trestle, the operation of all berths could be adversely impacted. This configuration is classified as a single berthing system. 
The physical boundaries of a berthing system may exclude unused sections of a structure. Excluded sections must be physically isolated from the berthing system. Expansion joints may provide this isolation. 
3102R1.4 Records. All Mars shall have records reflecting current, as-built conditions for all berthing systems. Records shall include, but not be limited to modifications and/or replacement of structural components, electrical or mechanical equipment or relevant operational changes, new construction including design drawings, calculations, engineering analyses, soil borings, equipment manuals, specifications, shop drawings, technical and maintenance manuals and documents. 
Chronological records and reports of annual inspections, audits and post-event inspections and documentation of equipment or structural changes shall be maintained. 
Records shall be indexed and be readily accessible to the Division (see 2 CCR Section 2320 (c) (2)) [2.1]. 
3102F.1.5 Baseline inspection. If "as-built" or subsequent modification drawings are not available, incomplete or inac­curate, a baseline inspection is required to gather data in suf 
ficient detail for adequate evaluaton. 
The level of detail required shall be such that structural member sizes, connection and reinforcing details are docu­mented, if required in the structural analysis. In addition, the strength and/or ductility characteristics of construction materials shall be determined, as appropriate. Nondestruc­tive testing, partially destructive testing and/or laboratory testing methods may be used. 
All fire, piping, mechanical and electrical systems shall be documented as to location, capacity, operating limits and 
physical conditions. 
3102F.2 Annual inspection. The annual inspection required by 2 CCR 2320 (a)( 1) [2.1], may include an engineering exam­ination of the topside and underside areas of the dock, includ­ing the splash zone. The Division shall perform the inspection, with cooperation from the owner/operator. Observations will be recorded and a report of violations and deficiencies shall be provided to the operator. 
Subject to operating procedures, a boat shall be provided to facilitate the inspection of the dock undersides and piles down to the splash zone. Ifa boat is not available or the under dock inspection cannot be performed by the Division during the annual inspection, the MOT operator shall carry out or cause to be carried out, such an inspection. The .operator will then provide the Division with a report detailing the examination results including photographs, videos and sketches as neces­sary to accurately depict the state of the underside of the dock. 
3102F.3 Audits. 
3102F.3.1 Objective. The objective of the audit is to review structural, mechanical and electrical systems on a pre­scribed periodic basis to verify that each berthing system is fit for its specific defined purpose. 
3102F.3.2 Overview. The audit shall include above water and underwater inspections, and structural, electrical and mechanical systems evaluations, with supporting documen­tation, drawings and follow-up actions. Structural systems shall include seismic, operational, mooring, berthing and geotechnical considerations. Mechanical systems shall include fire, piping/pipelines and mechanical equipment considerations. The audit is performed by a multi-disciplin­ary team of engineers, qualified inspectors and may include Division representatives. 
The above water inspection involves an examination of all structural, mechanical and electrical components above the waterline. Structural defects and their severity shall be doc­umented, but the exact size and location of each deficiency is typically not required.

The underwater inspection involves an examination of all structural, mechanical and electrical components below the waterline. A rational and representative underwater sam­pling of piles may be acceptable with Division approval, for cases of limited visibility, heavy marine growth, restricted inspection times because of environmental factors (cur­rents, water temperatures, etc.) or a very large number of piles. 
Global operational structural assessment rating(s) (OSAR), global seismic structural assessment rating(s) (SSAR) and global inspection condition assessment rat­ing(s) (/CAR) shall be assigned to each structure and over­all berthing system, where appropriate (Table 3/F-2-4). 
Remedial action priorities (RAP) shall be assigned for component deficiencies (Table 3/F-2-5). Recommendations for remediation and/or upgrading shall be prescribed as nec­
essary. 
An audit is not considered complete until the audit report is received by the Division. 
3102R3.3 Schedule. 
3102R3.3.1 1nitial audit. For a new MOT or new berth­ing system(s), the initial audit of the "as-built" sys­tems(s) shall be performed prior to commencement of operations. 
3102R3.3.2 Subsequent audits. A subsequent audit report of each terminal shall be completed at a maximum interval of4 years, and includes documentation of inspec­tions. This interval may be reduced, based on the recom­mendation of the audit team leader; and with the approval of the Division, depending on the extent and rate of deteri­oration or other factors.

verifying the maximum or loaded draft specified in the MGT's Operations Manual (2 CCR 2385 (d)) [2. 1]. 
The underwater structural inspection shall include the Level I, II and III inspection efforts, as shown in Tables 31F-2-2 and 31F-2-3. The underwater inspection levels of effort are described below, per [2.2]: 
Level /-Includes a close visual examination, or a tactile examination using large sweeping motions of the hands where visibility is limited. Although the Level Ieffort is often referred to as a "swim-by " inspection, it must be detailed enough to detect obvious major damage or deterioration due to overstress or other severe deterioration. It should confirm the continuity of the full length of all members and detect undermining or exposure of normally buried ele­ments. A Level I effort may also include limited probing of the substructure and adjacent channel bottom. 
Level II-A detailed inspection which requires marine growth removal from a representative sampling of compo­nents within the structure. For piles, a 12-inch high band should be cleaned at designated locations, generally near the low waterline, at the mud-line, and midway between the low waterline and the mudline. On a rectangular pile, the marine growth removal should include at least three sides; on an octagon pile, at least six sides; on a round pile, at least three-fourths of the perimeter. On large diam­eter piles, 3ft or greater, marine growth removal should be effected on 1 ft by 1 ft areas at four locations approxi­mately equally spaced around the perimeter, at each ele­vation. On large solid faced elements such as retaining structures, marine growth removal should be effected on 1 
ft by 1ft areas at the three specified elevations. The inspec­
tion should also focus on typical areas of weakness, such 
as attachment points and welds. The Level II effort is

cant damage to the encasement is present, or if evi­dence of significant deterioration of the underlying component is present, then the damage evaluation should consider whether the encasement was provided 
for protection and/or structural capacity. Encasements should not typically be removed for an audit. 
For encasements on which the formwork has been left in place, the inspection should focus on the integ­rity of the encasement, not the formwork. Levell and Level II efforts in such cases should concentrate on the top and bottom of the encasement. For concrete com­ponents, if deterioration, loss of bonding, or other sig­nificant problems with the encasement are suspected, it may be necessary to conduct a special inspection, including coring of the encasement and laboratory evaluation of the materials. 
3102R3.5.3.3 Wrapped components. For steel, con­crete or timber components that have been wrapped, the Level l and II efforts should focus on the evaluation of the integrity of the wrap. Since the effectiveness of a wrap may be compromised by removal, and since the removal and re-installation of wraps is time-consum­ing, it should not be routinely done. However, if evi­dence of significant damage exists, or if the effectiveness of the wraps is in question, then samples should be removed to facilitate the inspection and eval­uation. The samples may be limited to particular zones or portions of members if damage is suspected, based on the physical evidence of potential problems. A mini­mum sample size of three members should be used. A 
five-percent sample size, up to 30 total members, may be adequate as an upper limit. 
For wrapped timber components, Level Ill efforts should consist of removal of the wraps from a represen­tative sample of components in order to evaluate the condition of the timber beneath the wrap. The sample may be limited to particular zones or portions of the members if damage is suspected (e.g., at the mudline/ bottom of wrap or in the tidal zone). The sample size should be determined based on the physical evidence of potential problems and the aggressiveness of the environment. A minimum sample size of three members should be used. A five-percent sample size, up to 30 total members, may be adequate as an upper limit. 
3102F.3.5.4 Mechanical and electrical inspections. The 
mechanical and electrical inspections shall include but not be limited to the following:

3102F.3.6.1 Terminal operating limits. The physical boundaries of the facility shall be defined by the berthing system operating limits, along with the vessel size limits and environmental conditions. 
The audit shall include a "Statement of Terminal Operating Limits," which must provide a concise state­ment of the purpose of each berthing system in terms of operating limits. This description must at least include, the minimum and maximum vessel sizes, including Length Overall (LOA), beam, and maximum draft with associated displacement (see Fig. 31F-2-1). 
In establishing limits for both the minimum and maxi­mum vessel sizes, due consideration shall be given to water depths, dolphin spacing, fender system limita­tions, manifold height and hose/loading arm reach, with allowances for tidal fluctuations, surge and drift. 
Maximum wind, current or wave conditions, or combi­nations thereof, shall be clearly defined as limiting con­ditions for vessels at each berth, both with and without active product transfer. 
3102R3.6.2 Mooring and berthing. Mooring and berth­ing analyses shall be peiformed in accordance with Sec­tion 3105F. The analyses shall be consistent with the terminal operating limits and the structural configura­tion of the wharf and/or dolphins and associated hard­ware. 
Based on inspection results, analyses and engineering 
judgment; mooring and berthing OSARs shall be 
assigned on a global basis, independently for each struc­
ture and overall berthing system. The OSARs defined in 
Table 31F-2-4 shall be used for this purpose. The moor­

Structural component deficiencies assigned RAPs as per Table 31F-2-5 shall be considered in the OSARs, SSARs and /CARs. The assigned ratings shall remain in effect until all the significant corrective action has been completed to the satisfaction of the Division, or until completion of the next audit. 
3102F.3.6.4Mechanical and electrical systems. An eval­uation of all mechanical and electrical systems and com­ponents shall be performed in accordance with Sections 3108F through 3111F of these standards. If a pipeline stress analysis is required (see Section 3109F.3), forces and imposed seismic displacements resulting from the structural analysis shall be considered. Mechanical and electrical component deficiencies shall be assigned rat­ings from Table 31F-2-5.

and methodology of any supplemental inspections (e.g., special inspections (see Section 3102F.3.5.3). 
The following information may be important in determining the need for, and methodology of, the post-event inspection: 
1. 	Earthquakes or vessel or debris impact typically cause damage both above and below the waterline. 

II 
Following a major earthquake, the inspection should 
focus on components likely to attract highest lateral loads (batter or shorter piles in the rear of the struc­ture, etc.). In case of vessel or debris impact, the inspection effort should focus on components in the path of the impact mass. 

2. 
Major floods or tsunamis may cause undermining of II the structure, and/or scouring at the mudline. 

3. 	
Fire damage varies significantly with the type of con­struction materials but all types may be adversely affected. Special inspections (sampling and labora­tory testing) shall be conducted, as determined by the inspection team leader, in order to determine the nature and extent of damage. 

4. 	
High wind or wave events often cause damage both above and below the waterline. An underwater inspec­



II 
tion may be required if damage is visible above the water­line. Structural damage may be potentially increased if a vessel was at the berth during the event. The effects of high wind may be most prevalent on equipment and con­nections of such equipment to the structure. 

The methodology of conducting an underwater post-event inspection should be established with due consideration of the structure type and type of damage anticipated. Whereas slope failures or scour may be readily apparent in waters of adequate visibility, overstressing cracks on piles covered with marine growth will not be readily apparent. Where such hid­den damage is suspected, marine growth removal should be performed on a representative sampling of components in accordance with the Level II effort requirements described in Section 3 102F.3 .5.2. The cause of the event will determine the appropriate sample size and locations. 
3102F.4.4 Post-event ratings. A post-event rating [2.2] shall be assigned to each berthing system upon completion of the inspection (see Table 3IF-2-9). All observations of the above and under water structure, mechanical and elec­trical components and systems shall be considered in assigning a post-event rating. 

Ratings should consider only damage that was likely caused by the event. Pre-existing deterioration such as cor­rosion damage should not be considered unless the struc­tural integrity is immediately threatened or safety systems or protection of the environment may be compromised. 
Assignment of ratings should reflect an overall character­ization of the berthing system being rated. The rating shall consider both the severity of the deterioration and the extent to which it is widespread throughout the facility. The fact that the facility was designed for loads that are lower than the current standards for design should have no influence upon the ratings. 
3102F.4.5 Follow-up actions. Follow-up actions shall be assigned upon completion of the post-event inspection of 





each berthing system. Table 3IF-2-5 specifies remedial 
action priorities for deficiencies. Table 31F-2-6 specifies 
various follow-up actions. Multiple follow-up actions may 
be assigned; however, guidance should be provided as to the 
order in which the follow-up actions should be carried-out. 
Follow-up actions shall be subject to Division approval. 


3102F.4.6 Documentation and reporting. Documentation 
of the specific attributes of each defect shall not be required 
during a post-event inspection. However, a narrative 
description of significant damage shall be used. The 
description shall be consistent with and shall justify the 
post-event rating assigned. 



A report shall be prepared and submitted to the Division 
upon

SECTION 3103F 
STRUCTURAL LOADING CRITERIA 


3103F.l General. Section 3103F establishes the environmen­tal and operating loads acting on the marine oil terminal (MOT) structures and on moored vessel( s ). The analysis proce­dures are presented in Sections 3104F -3107F. 
3103F.2 Dead loads. 
3103F.2.1 GeneraL Dead loads shall include the weight of the entire structure, including permanent attachments such as loading arms, pipelines, deck crane, fire monitor tower, gang-. way strncture, vapor control equipment and mooring hard­ware. Unit weights specified in Section 31 03F.2.2 may be used 
for MOT strnctures if actual weights are not available. 
3103F.2.2 Unit weights. The unit weights in Table 31F-3-1 may be used for both existing and new MOTs.

3103F.2.3 Equipment and piping area loads. The equip­
ment and piping area loads in Table 31F-3-2 may be used, 
as a minimum, in lieu of detailed as-built data.

***pounds per square foot 
3103F.3 Live loads and buoyancy. The following vertical live loading shall be considered, where appropriate: uniform load­ing, truck loading, crane loading and buoyancy. Additionally, MOT specific, nonpermanent equipment shall be identified and used in loading computations. 
3103F.4 Earthquake loads. 
3103F.4.1 GeneraL Earthquake loads are described in terms of Peak Ground Acceleration ( PGA), spectral acceleration and earthquake magnitude. The required seismic analysis procedures (Tables 31 F -4-2 and 31 F-4-3) are dependent on the risk classification obtained from Table 31 F -4-1. 

3103F.4.2 Design earthquake motion parameters. The earthquake ground motion parameters of peak ground acceleration, spectral acceleration and earthquake magni­tude are modified for site amplification and near fault directivity effects. The resulting values are the design peak ground acceleration (DPGA), design spectral acceleration (DSA) and design earthquake magnitude (DEM). 
· The peak ground and spectral acceleration may be evalu­ated using: 
1. 	
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) or California Geo­logical Survey [CGS, formerly the California Divi­sion of Mines and Geology (CDMG)] maps as discussed in Section 3103F.4.2.2, 

2. 
A site-specific probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) as discussed in Section 3103F.4.2.3. 

3. 
For the Ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Port Hueneme, PSHA results are provided 
in Section 3103F.4.2.3. 


Unless stated otherwise, the DSA values are for 5 percent damping; values at other levels may be obtained as per Sec­tion 3103F.4.2.9. 
The appropriate probability levels associated with DPGA and DSA for different seismic performance levels are pro­vided in Table 31F-4 -2. Deterministic earthquake motions, which are used only for comparison to the probabilistic results, are addressed in Section 3103F.4.2. 7. 
The evaluation of Design Earthquake Magnitude (DEM), is discussed in Section 3103F.4.2.8. This parameter is required when acceleration time histories (Section 3103F.4.2.10) are addressed or if liquefaction potential (Section 3106F.3) is being evaluated. 
3103F.4.2.1 Site classes. The following site classes, defined in Section 31 06F.2, shall be used in developing values of DSA and DPGA: 
SA, SIP S0 Sv, SE and Sp 
For SF> a site-specific response analysis is required per Section 3103F.4.2.5. 
3103F.4.2.2 Earthquake motions from USGS maps. 
Earthquake ground motion parameters can be obtained from the Maps 29-32 in the National Earthquake Haz­ard Reduction Program (NEHRP) design map set dis­cussed in subsection 1.6.1 of [3.1], or the USGS web­site: (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/hazmapsl). These are available as peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration values at 5 percent damping for 10 and 2 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years, which correspond to Average Return Periods (ARPs) of 475 and 2,475 years, respectively. The spectral acceler­ation values are available for 0.2, and 1.0 second spec­tral periods. In obtaining peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration values from the USGS web site, the site location can be specified in terms of site longi­tude and latitude or the zip code when appropriate. The 


JANUARY 1, 2014 ERRATA 	2013 CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE 
BUFF 



resulting values of peak ground acceleration and spec­
tral acceleration correspond to surface motions for Site 
Classification approximately corresponding to the 




boundary of Site Class SB and S0 
Once peak ground acceleration and spectral accelera­tion values are obtained for 10 and 2 percent probability of exceedence in 50 years, the corresponding values for other probability levels may be obtained. A procedure is presented in subsection 1.6 of Chapter 1 of£3.1]. 
3103F.4.2.3 Earthquake motionsfrom site-specific probabilistic seismic ha:rJud analyses. Peak ground accel­eration and spectral acceleration values can be obtained using site-specific probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). In this approach, the seismic sources and their characterization used in the analysis shall be based on the published data from the California Geological Survey, which can be obtained online at the following website: (http://www.conservation.ca.gov/CGS/PagesHndex.aspx) [3.2]. 
Appropriate attenuation relationships shall be used to obtain values of peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration at the ground surface for site conditions corre­sponding to the boundary ofSite Class SBand s" regardless of the actual subsurface conditions at the site. These results shall be compared to those based on the FEMAIUSGS maps discussed in Section 3103F.4.2.2. If the two sets of values are significantly different, a justification for using the characterization chosen shall be provided. 
Alternatively, peak ground acceleration and spectral accelerations at the ground surface for the subsurface conditions that actually exist at the site may be directly 

MARINE OIL TERMINALS 
obtained by using appropriate attenuation relationships 
in a site-specific PSHA. This approach is not permissible for Site Classes S E and SF-
For site-specific PSHA, peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration values corresponding to the seis­mic performance level (See Table 31F-4-2) shall be obtained. 
For peak ground acceleration, PSHA may be conducted using the "magnitude weighting" procedure in Idriss [3.3]. The actual magnitude weighting values should fol­low the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) procedures [3.4]. This magnitude weighting procedure incorporates the effects of duration corresponding to vari­ous magnitude events in the PSHA.results. The resulting peak ground acceleration shall be used only for liquefac­tion assessment (see Section 3106F.4). 
PSHA have been developed for the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach [3.5, 3.6] and provide site-spe­cific information for seismic analyses. Table 31F-3-3 provides response spectra, for a 475 year return period earthquake and 5 percent critical damping. Figure 31F-3-1 provides the corresponding spectra for the two ports. Additionally, these references provide spectra for return periods from 72 to 2,500 years. 
For the port of Port Hueneme, a PSHA was performed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [3. 7] and the results are shown in Table 31F-3-4 and Figure 31 F -3-2. These results are provided only for site classifi­cation "Sc" and five percent critical damping. To obtain appropriate values for piles and/or the mudline, the sim­plified procedures of Section 3103F.4.2.4 may be used.

3103F.4.2.4 Simplified evaluation of site amplification effects. When the MOT Site Class is different from the S8 ­Sc boundary, site amplification effects shall be incorpo­rated in peak ground accelerations and spectral acceler­ations. This may be accomplished using a simplified method or a site-specific evaluation (Section 3103F.4.2.5). 
For a given site class, the following procedure [3. 1] presents a simplified method that may be used to incor­porate the site amplification effects for peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration computed for the S8 and Sc boundary. 
1. 	Calculate the spectral acceleration values at 0.20 
and 1.0 second period:  
Sxs =FaSs  (3-1)  
Sxl =F. Sl  (3-2)  
where:  

Fa = 	site coefficient obtained from Table 31F-3-5 
F. = 	site coefficient obtained from Table 31F-3-6 
S8 = short period (usually at 0.20 seconds) spectral acceleration value (for the boundary of S8 and Sc) obtained using Section 3103F.4.2.2, or at the period corresponding to the peak in spec­tral acceleration values when obtained from Section 3103F.4.2.3 

sl = 	spectral acceleration value (for the boundary 
of S8 and Sc) at 1.0 second period 

Sxs= 	spectral acceleration value obtained using the 

short period S, and factored by Table 31F-3-5 
for the Site Class under consideration. 


Sx1 = spectral acceleration value obtained using the 
1.0 
second period S1 and factored by Table 31F-3-6 for the Site Class under consider­ation. 

2. 
SetPGAx =0.4Sxs 	(3-3) 



where: 
PG4x = peak ground acceleration corresponding to 
the Site Class under consideration. 


When the value of PGAx is less than the peak ground acceleration obtained following Section 3103F.4.2.2 or Section 3103F.4.2.3, an explanation of the results shall be provided. 
3. 	
PGAx, SXS> and Sx1 constitute three spectral accel­
eration values for the Site Class under consider­
ation corresponding to periods ofO, S8 (usually 0.2 
seconds), and 1.0 second, respectively. 


4. 
The final response spectra, without consideration 
for near-fault directivity effects, values of Sa for 



the Site Class under consideration may be obtained using the following equations (for 5 per­cent critical damping): 
for 	0 < T < 0.2T0 

(3-4) 
where: 
T = Period corresponding to calculated Sa 
T0 = 	Period at which the constant acceleration and 

constant velocity regions of the design spec­trum intersect 
for 	0.2T0 < T< T0 
0 
Sa=Sxs 	(3-5) 
for 	T> T0 
Sa=Sx/f' 	(3-6) 
CJ
where: 
T0 = Sx/Sxs 	(3-7) 

The resulting PGAx is the DPGA. However, the Sa (except for the ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Port Hueneme) shall be modified for near-fault directivity effects, per Section 3103F.4.2. 6 to obtain the 


final DSAs.

3103F.4.2.5 Site-specific evaluation ofamplification effects. As an alternative to the procedure presented in Section 31 03F.4.2.4, a site-specific response analysis may be performed. 

The analysis shall be either an equivalent linear or nonlinear analysis. Appropriate acceleration time his­tories as discussed in Section 3103F.4.2.10 shall be used. 
In general, an equivalent linear analysis using, for example, SHAKE91 [3.8] is acceptable when the strength and stiffness of soils are unlikely to change significantly during the seismic shaking, and the level of shaking is not large. A nonlinear analysis should be used when the strength and/or stiffness of soils could significantly change during the seismic shaking or significant nonlinearity of soils is expected because of high seismic shaking levels. 
The choice of the method used in site response analysis shall be justified considering the expected stress-strain behavior of soils under the shaking level considered in the analysis. 
Site-specific site response analysis may be performed using one-dimensional analysis. However, to the extent that MOTs often involve slopes or earth retaining struc­tures, the one-dimensional analysis should be used judi­ciously. When one-dimensional analysis cannot be 
justified or is not adequate, two-dimensional equivalent linear or nonlinear response analysis shall be per­formed. Site-specific response analysis results shall be compared to those basedon the simplified method of Sec­tion 3103F.4.2.4 for reasonableness. 
For the port areas of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Port Hueneme, the resulting response spectra shall not fall below values obtained in Section 3103F.4.2.3. 
The peak ground accelerations obtained from this site-specific evaluation are DPGAs and the spectral accelerations are DSAs as long as the near-fault directivity effects addressed in Section 3103F.4.2. 6 are appropriately incorporated into the time histories (Sec­tion 3103F.4.2.10). 
31 03F.4.2.6 Directivity effects. When the site is 15 km (9.3 miles) or closer to a seismic source that can significantly affect the site, near-fault directivity effects shall be reflected in the spectral acceleration values and in the

deterministic spectral acceleration values of Section 3103F.4.2. 7. However, Tables 31F-3-3 and 31F-3-4 for the port areas of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Port Hueneme already have these effects included. 
Two methods are available for incorporating directivity effects. 
1. 
Directivity effects may be reflected in the spectral acceleration values in a deterministic manner by using, for example, the equation on pg. 213 (andTables 6and 7) ofSomerville, et al. [3.9]. The criti­

. cal seismic sources and their characterization devel­oped as part of the deterministic ground motion parameters (Section 3103F.4.2. 7) should be used to evaluate the directivity effects. The resulting adjust­ments in spectral acceleration values may be applied in the probabilistic spectral acceleration values developed per Section 3103F.4.2.4 or 3103F.4.2.5. Such adjustment can be independent of the probabil­ity levels of spectral accelerations. 

2. 
Directivity effects may be incorporated in the results of site specific PSHA per Section 31 03F.4.2.3. 1n this case, the directivity effects will also depend on the probability level of spectral accelerations. 


If spectral accelerations are obtained in this manner, the effects of site amplification using either Section 3103F.4.2.4, 3103F.4.2.5 or an equivalent method (if justified) shall be incorporated. 
3103F.4.2. 7 Deterministicearthquake motions.Deter­ministic ground motions from "scenario " earthquakes may be used for comparison purposes. Deterministic peak ground accelerations and spectral accelerations may be obtained using the "Critical Seismic Source " with maxi­mum earthquake magnitude and its closest appropriate distance to the MOT. "Critical Seismic Source" is that which results in the largest computed medianpeak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration values when appropriate attenuation relationships are used. The val­ues obtained from multiple attenuation relationships should be used to calculate the median peak ground accel­eration and spectral acceleration values. 
For comparison, the values of peak ground accelera­tions and spectral accelerations may be obtained from the USGS maps [3. 1], corresponding to the Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE). In this case, the median values of peak ground acceleration and spectral acceler­ation values shall be 213 (see Subsection 1.6 of£3.1]) of the values shown on the USGS maps. 
3103F.4.2.8 Designearthquake magnitude. The design earthquake magnitude used in developing site-specific acceleration time histories (Section 3103F.4.2.10) or liq­uefaction assessment (Section 31 06F.3) is obtained using either of the following two methods. 
1. The design earthquake may be selected as the larg­est earthquake magnitude associated with the crit­ical seismic source. The distance shall be taken as the closest distance from the source to the site. The resulting design earthquake shall be associated with all DPGA values for the site, irrespective of probability levels. 



2. 	The design earthquake (DEQ) may be obtained for 
each DPGA or DSA value and associated proba­
bility level by determining the corresponding dom­
inant distance and magnitude. These are the 
values of the distance and magnitude that contrib­
ute the most to the mean seismic hazards estimates 

for the probability of interest. They are usually determined by locating the summits of the 3-D sur­face of contribution of each small interval of mag­nitude and distance to the total mean hazards estimate. If this 3-D suiface shows several modes with approximate weight of more than 20 percent of the total, several DEQs may be considered, and the DEQ leading to the most conservative design parameters shall be used. 



3103F.4.2.9 Designspectral acceleration for various damping values. Design spectral acceleration (DSA) values at damping other than 5 percent shall be obtained by using a procedure given in [3.1], and is denoted as DSAd. The following procedure does not include near-fault directivity effects.

3103F.4.2.10 Development ofacceleration time histories. When acceleration time histories are utilized, target spectral acceleration values shall be initially selected corresponding to the DSA values at appropriate probability levels. For each set of target spectral acceleration values corresponding to one probability level, at least three sets of horizontal time histories (one or two horizontal acceleration time histories per set) shall be developed. 

Initial time histories shall consider magnitude, distance and the type of fault that are reasonably similar to those associated with the conditions contributing most to the probabilistic DSA values. Preferred initial time histories should have their earthquake magnitude and distance to the seismic source similar to the mode-magnitude and mode-distance derived from the PSHA or from appropri­ate maps. When an adequate number of recorded time his­tories are not available, acceleration time histories from simulations may be used as supplements. 
Scaling or adjustments, either in the frequency domain or in the time domain (preferably), prior to generating acceleration time histories should be kept to a minimum. When the target spectral accelerations include near-fault directivity effects (Section 3103F.4.2.6), the initial time histories should exhibit directivity effects. 
When three sets of time histories are used in the analy­sis, the envelope of the spectral acceleration values from each time history shall be equal to or higher than the tar­

() 	get spectral accelerations. If the envelope values fall below the target values, adjustments shall be made to ensure that the spectral acceleration envelope is higher than target spectral accelerations. If the envelope is not higher, thenajustification shall be provided. 
When seven or more sets of time histories are used, the average of the spectral acceleration values from the set of time histories shall be equal or higher than the target 
spectral acceleration values. If the average values fall below the target values, adjustments shall be made to ensure that average values are higher than the target spectral accelerations. If this is not the case, then an explanation for the use of these particular spectral accel­eration values shall be provided. 


When three sets of time histories are used in the analysis, the maximum value of each response parameter shall be used in the design, evaluation and rehabilitation. When seven or more sets of time histories are used in the analysis, the average value of each response parameter may be used. 

3103F.5 Mooring loads onvessels. 
3103F.5.1 General. Forces acting on a moored vessel may be generated by wind, waves, current, tidal variations, tsuna­mis, seiches and hydrodynamic effects of passing vessels. Forces from wind and current acting directly on the Mar structure (not through the vessel in the form of mooring and/ or breasting loads) shall be determined in Section 3103F.7. 

(_) 
The vessel's moorings shall be strong enough to hold dur­ing all expected conditions of surge, current and weather 
2013 CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE 

MARINE OIL TERMINALS 



and long enough to allow adjustment for changes in draft, drift and tide (2 CCR 2340 (c) (1)) [3.10]. 
3103F.5.2 Wind loads. Wind loads on a vessel, moored at a MOT , shall be determined using procedures described in this section. Wind loads shall be calculated for each of the load cases identified in Section 3105F.2. 
3103F.5.2.1 Design wind speed. The design wind speed is the maximum wind speed of 30-second duration used in the mooring analysis (see Section 3105F). 
3103F.5.2.1.1 Operating condition. The operating condition is the wind envelope in which a vessel may conduct transfer operations. It is determined from the mooring analysis (Section 3105F). Transfer opera­tions shall cease, at an existing MOT, when the wind exceeds the maximum velocity of the envelope. 
3103F.5.2.1.2 Survival condition. The survival con­dition is defined as the state wherein a vessel can remain safely moored at the berth during severe winds. For new MOTs, the survival condition thresh­old is the maximum wind velocity, for a 30-second gust and a 25-year return period, obtained from his­torical data. 
For an existing Mar, a reduced survival condition threshold is acceptable (see Figure 31F-2-l). If the wind rises above these levels, the vessel must depart the berth; it shall be able to depart within 30 minutes (see 2 CCR 2340 (c) (28)) [3.10]. 
The 30-second duration wind speed shall be deter­mined from the annual maximum wind data. Average annual summaries cannot be used. Maximum wind speed data for eight directions ( 45-degree increments) shall be obtained. If other duration wind data is avail­able, it shall be adjusted to a 30-second duration, in accordance with Equation (3.12). The 25-year return period shall be used to establish the design wind speed for each direction. In order to simplify the analysis for < barges (or other small vessels), they may be considered to be solid free-standing walls (Chapter 6 of ASCE 7 [3.11]). This will eliminate the need to perform a com­
puter assisted mooring analysis. 
3103F.5.2.2Wind speed corrections. Wind speed mea­sured at an elevation of 33 feet (10 meters) above the water surface, with duration of 30 seconds shall be used to determine the design wind speed. If these conditions are not met, the following corrections shall be applied. 
The correction for elevation is obtained from the equation: 

(3-11) 
where: 

Vw =wind speed at elevation 33ft. (10m.) 
vh = wind speed at elevation h 
h = elevation above water surface of wind data [feet] 






The available wind duration shall be adjusted to a 30-second value, using the following formula: 
vt=0 sec = v, (3-12) 
3c, 
where: 
V, 30 sec = wind speed for a 30-second duration 
= 
V, = wind speed over a given duration 
c, = conversion factor from Figure 31F-3-3 
If wind data is available over land only, the following equation shall be used to convert the wind speed from over-land to over-water conditions [3.10]: 
Vw=1.JOVL (3-13) 
where: 
Vw = over water wind speed 
VL = over land wind speed 
31 03R5.2.3 Static wind loads on vessels.The "Mooring Equipment Guidelines (MEG3)" [3.13] or the "British Standard Code of Practice for Maritime Structures" 
[3.14] shall be used to determine the wind loads for all tank vessels. 
Alternatively, wind loads for any type of vessel may be calculated using the guidelines in Ferritto et al, 1999 


[3.15]. 

3103F.5.3 Current loads. Environmental loads induced by 
currents at MOTs shall be calculated as specified in this 
subsection. 

3103R5.3.1 Design current velocity. Maximum ebb and flood currents, annual river runoffs and controlled releases shall be considered when establishing the design current velocities for both existing and new MOTs. 
Local current velocities may be obtained from NOAA 
[3.16] or other sources, but must be supplemented by site-specific data, if the current velocity is higher than 
1.5 knots. 
Site-specific data shall be obtained by real time mea­surements over a one-year period. If this information is not available, a safety factor of 1.25 shall be applied to the best available data until real time measurements are obtained. 
If the facility is not in operation during annual river runoffs and controlled releases, the current loads may be adjusted. 
Operational dates need to be clearly stated in the defi­nition of the terminal operating limits (see Section 3102F.3.6). 
3103F.5.3.2 Currentvelocity adjustment factors. An average current velocity (Vc) shall be used to compute forces and moments. lf the current velocity profile is known, the average current velocity can be obtained from the following equation: 


T
2

Vc = 1 I TJ (vc )2 ds (3-14) 
0 


where: 
Vc = average current velocity (knots) 
(J
T = draft of vessel 
v c = current velocity as a function of depth (knots) 
s = water depth measured from the suiface 

If the velocity profile is not known, the velocity at a 
known water depth should be adjusted by the factors pro­

0 

vided in Figure 31 F-3-4 to obtain the equivalent average 
velocity over the draft of the vessel. 

3103R5.3.3Staticcurrentloads. The OC1MF [3. 13], 
the British Standard [3.14] or the UFC 4-159-03 [3.17] 
procedures shall be used to determine current loads for 
moored tank vessels. 

3103F.5.3.4Sealevel rise (SLR).All MOTs shall con­
sider the predicted SLR over the remaining life of the ter­
minal, due to subsidence or climate change combined 
with maximum high tide and storm surge. Consideration 
shall include but not be limited to variation in fender 
locations, additional berthing loads (deeper draft ves­

sels) and any components near the splash zone. ()

3103R5.4 Wave loads.When the significant wave period, Ts, is greater than 4 seconds (See Section 3105F.3.1), the trans­verse wave induced vessel reactions shall be calculated using 
a simplified dynamic mooring analysis described below. 
The horizontal water particle accelerations shall be cal­culated for the various wave conditions, taken at the mid-depth of the loaded vessel draft. The water particle accelerations shall then be used to calculate the wave exci­tation forces to determine the static displacement of the ves­sel. The Froude-Krylov method discussed in Chakrabarti's 
Chapter 7 [ 3.18 I may be used to calculate the wave excita­tion forces, by conservatively approximating the vessel as a rectangular box with dimensions similar to the actual dimensions of the vessel. The horizontal water particle accelerations shall be calculated for the various wave con­ditions, taken at the mid-depth of the loaded vessel draft. The computed excitation force assumes a 90-degree inci­dence angle with the longitudinal axis of the vessel, which will result in forces that are significantly greater than the forces that will actually act upon the vessel from quartering \__)
seas. A load reduction factor may be used to account for the design wave incidence angle from the longitudinal axis of the ship. The overall excursion of the vessel shall be deter­mined for each of the wave conditions by calculating the dynamic response of the linear spring mass system.

3103F.5.5 Passing vessels. When required in Section 3105F.3, the sway and surge forces, as well as yaw moment, on a moored vessel, due to passing vessels, shall be estab­lished considering the following: 
1. 	
Ratio of length of moored vessel to length of passing vessel. 

2. 	
Distance from moored vessel to passing vessel. 

3. 	
Ratio of midship section areas of the moored and passing vessels. 

4. 	
Underkeel clearances of the moored and passing ves­sels. 

5. 	
Draft and trim of the moored vessel and draft of the passing vessel. 

6. 	
Mooring line tensions. 



The passing vessel's speed should take into consideration the ebb or flood current. Normal operating wind and cur­rent conditions can be assumed when calculating forces due to a passing vessel. Either method ofKrieble [3.19 1 or Wang 
[3.20] may be used to determine forces on a moored vessel. Kriebel's recent wave tank study improves on an earlier work of Seelig [3.21]. 
3103F.5.6 Seiche. The penetration of long period low amplitude waves into a harbor can result in resonant stand­ing wave systems, when the wave forcing frequency coin­cides with a natural frequency of the harbor. The resonant standing waves can result in large surge motions if this fre­quency is close to the natural frequency of the mooring sys­tem. Section 3105F.3.3 prescribes the procedure for the evaluation of these effects. 
3103F.5. 7 Tsunamis. A tsunami may be generated by an earthquake or a subsea or coastal landslide, which may induce large wave heights and excessive currents. The large wave or surge and the excessive currents are potentially damaging, especially if there is a tank vessel moored along­side the MOT wharf. 
Tsunamis can be generated either by a distant or near source. A tsunami generated by a distant source (far field event) may allow operators to have an adequate warning for mitigating the risk by depart the MOT and go into deep water. For near-field events, with sources less than 500 miles away, the vessel may not have adequate time to depart. Each MOT shall have a "tsunami plan" describing what actions will be performed, in the event of a distant tsunami. 
Recent tsunami studies have been completed for both Southern and Northern California. For the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, one of those recent studies 
focused on near field tsunamis with predicted return periods of5,000 to 10,000 years [3.221. These maximum water lev­els (run-up) would not normally be used for MOT design. However, because the study also provides actual tidal records from recent distant tsunamis, it should be used for design. 
The run-up value for Port Hueneme was obtained from an earlier study by Synolakis et al. [3.231. 
Run up-values: PortofLosAngelesandLong Beach= 8ft. 
Port Hueneme = 11ft. 

For the San Francisco Bay, a recent study provides the maximum credible tsunami water levels and current speeds. These results are deterministic and are based on the most severe seismic sources that could reasonably impact MOTs in the San Francisco Bay [3.241. Table 31F-3-8 provides values for the marine oil terminal locations within San Francisco Bay. Water levels could be positive or negative and current velocities may vary in direction. In order to determine the maximum run-up at a MOT, the largest values should be added to the mean high tide. Further details are available in [3.241. 
Loads from tsunami-induced waves can be calculated for various structural configurations [3.25 1. Tsunami wave heights in shallow water and particle kinematics can also be obtained. Other structural considerations include uplift and debris impact.

3103F.6 Berthing Loads. 
3103F.6.1 General. Berthing loads are quantified in terms of transfer of kinetic energy of the vessel into potential energy dissipated by the fender( s ). The terms and equations below are based on those in UFC 4-152-01, "Piers and Wharves" [3.261 and PIANC [3.271. < 
Kinetic energy shall be calculated from the following equation:

Evessel = 2 Vn 	(3-15) 
g 

where: 
Evessel =Berthing energy ofvessel [ft-lbs1 W = Total weight of vessel and cargo in pounds [long

MARINE OIL TERMINALS 

0 The following correction factors shall be used to modify the actual energy to be absorbed by the fender system for berthing operations: 

Efender =FA ·Cb ·Cm ·Evessel 	(3-I6) 
where: 


Efender =Energy to be absorbed by the fender system 
FA = 	Accidental factor accounting for abnormal condi­
tions such as human error, malfunction, adverse environmental conditions or a combination of these factors. For existing berthing systems, FA may be taken as 1.0. For new berthing systems, FA shall be determined in accordance with UFC Sec­tion 4-I52-0I [3.26] or PIANC Section 4.2.8 [3.27]. 
Cb =Berthing Coefficient 

Cm = Effective mass or virtual mass coefficient (see Sec­tion 3103F.6.6) 

The berthing coefficient, cb> is given by: 
c. =Ce ·Cg ·Cd ·Cc 	(3-I7) 
where: 

Ce = Eccentricity Coefficient Cc = Configuration Coefficient Cg = Geometric Coefficient () Cd =Deformation Coefficient 

These coefficients are defined in Sections 3103F.6.2 through 3I03F.6.5. 
The approximate displacement of the vessel (when only partially loaded) at impact, DT, can be determined from an extension of an equation from Gaythwaite [3.28]: 
(3-I8) 
where: 

DWT = Dead Weight Tonnage (in long tons) 

0 
dacruaz = Actual arrival draft of the vessel dmax = Maximum loaded vessel draft 
The berthing load shall be based on the fender reaction 
due to the kinetic berthing energy. The structural capacity shall be established based on allowable concrete, steel or timber properties in the structural components, as defined in Section 3I 07F. 


3103F.6.2 Eccentricity coefficient (C.). During the berth­ing maneuver, when the vessel is not parallel to the berthing line (usually the wharf face), not all the kinetic energy of the vessel will be transmitted to the fenders. Due to the reaction from the fender( s ), the vessel will start to rotate around the contact point, thus dissipating part of its energy. Treating the vessel as a rigid rod of negligible width in the analysis of 
.( 
' the energy impact on the fenders leads to the equation: 
e
ce = 	(3-I9) 
2 +k2a 

where: 

k = Longitudinal radius of gyration of the vessel [ft] 
a =Distance between the vessel's center of gravity and the point of contact on the vessel's side, pro­jected onto the vessel's longitudinal axis [ft] 
3103F.6.3
Geometric coefficient (CJ. 
The geometric coef 
ficient, ell' depends upon the geometric configuration of the ship at the point ofimpact. Itvariesfrom 0. 85 for an increas­ing convex curvature to I.25 for concave curvature. Gener­
ally, 0.95 is recommended for the impact point at or beyond the quarter points of the ship, and I.O for broadside berth­ing in which contact is made along the straight side [ 3.26]. 
3103F.6.4Deformation coefficient (CJ. This accounts for the energy reduction effects dite to local deformation of the ships hull and deflection of the whole ship along its longitudinal axis. The energy absorbed by the ship depends on the relative stiffness of the ship and the obstruction. The deformation coef­ficient varies from 0.9 for a nonresilient fender to nearly I.O for a flexible fender. For larger ships on energy-absorbing fender systems, little or no deformation of the ship takes place; there­fore, a coefficient of 1.0 is recommended. 
3103F.6.5 Configuration coefficient (Ce). This factor accounts for the difference between an open pier or wharf and a solid pier or wharf. In the first case, the movements of the water surrounding the berthing vessel is not (or is hardly) affected by the berth. In the second case, the water between the berthing vessel and the structure introduces a cushion effect that represents an extra force on the vessel away from the berth and reduces the energy to be absorbed by the fender system. 
For open berth and corners of solid piers, Cc = I.O 
For solid piers with parallel approach, Cc = 0.8 

For berths with different conditions, Cc may be interpo­lated between these values [3.26]. 
3103F.6.6 Effective mass or virtual mass coefficient (CmJ. 
In determining the kinetic energy of a berthing vessel, the effective or the virtual mass is the sum of vessel mass and hydrodynamic mass. The hydrodynamic mass does not nec­essarily vary with the mass of the vessel, but is closely related to the projected area of the vessel at right angles to the direction of motion. 
Other factors, such as the form of vessel, water depth, berthing velocity, and acceleration or deceleration of the vessel, will have some effect on the hydrodynamic mass. Taking into account both model and prototype experiments, the effective or virtual mass coefficient can be estimated as: 
actual

Cm =1+2· d 	(3-20)
B 
where: 

dacrual = Actual arrival draft of the vessel B = Beam of vessel The value of Cmfor use in design should be a minimum of 

I.5 and need not exceed 2.0 [3.26].

3103F.6.7 Berthing velocity and angle. The berthing veloc­ity, V, is influenced by a large number of factors such as envi­ronmental conditions of the site (wind, current and wave), method ofberthing (with or without tugboat assistance), con­dition of the vessel during berthing (ballast or fully laden) and human factors (experience of the tugboat captain). 
The berthing velocity, normal to berth, shall be in accor­

> dance with Table 31 F-3-9. Site condition is determined from 
> Table 31F-3-10. 
Subject to Division approval, if an existing MOT can dem­onstrate lower velocities by utilizing velocity monitoring equipment, then such a velocity may be used temporarily until the berthing system is compliant with this Code. 

In order to obtain the normal berthing velocity, V, an approach angle, defined as the angle formed by the fender line and the longitudinal axis of the vessel must be determined. The berthing angles, used to compute the normal berthing velocity, 
Jot various vessel sizes are shown in Table 31F-3-ll.

3103F. 7 Wind and current loads onstructures. 
31 03F. 7.1 GeneraLThis section provides methods to deter­mine the wind and current loads acting on the structure directly, as opposed to wind and current forces acting on the structure from a moored vessel. 

3103F.7.2 Wind loads. Chapter 6 of ASCE 7[3. 11] shall be used to establish minimum wind loads on the structure. Additional information about wind loads may be obtained from Simiu and Scanlan [3.29]. 
3103F. 7.3 Current loads. The current forces acting on the structure may be established using the current velocities, per Section 3103F.5.3. 
3103F.8Load combinations. As a minimum, each component of the structure shall be analyzed for all applicable load combi­nations given in Table 31F-3-12 or 31F-3-13, depending on component type. For additional load combinations see "Piers and Wharves," DOD UFC4-152-01 [3.26]. 
The "vacant condition" is the case wherein there is no vessel at the berth. The ·mooring and breasting condition " exists after the vessel is securely tied to the whaif. The "berthing condition " occurs as the vessel impacts the whaif, and the "earthquake condition" assumes no vessel is at the berth, and there is no wind or current forces on the structure. 
The use of various load types is discussed below: 
31 03F.8.1 Dead load (D). Upper and lower bound values of dead load are applied for the vacant condition to check the maximum moment and shear with minimum axial load. 
3103F.8.2 Live load (L). The live load on MOTs is typically small and is therefore neglected for combinations including earthquake loads. 
3103F.8.3 Buoyancyload(B). Buoyancy forces shall be considered for any submerged or immersed substructures (including pipelines, sumps and structural components). 
3103F.8.4 Wind (W) and current (C) on the structure. Wind and currents on the vessel are included in the mooring and

breasting condition. The wind and current loads acting on the structure are therefore additional loads that can act simulta­neously with the mooring, breasting and/or berthing loads. 
3103F.8.5 Earth pressure on the structure (H). The soil pressure on end walls, typically concrete cut-off walls, steel sheet pile walls on wharf type structures and/or piles shall be considered. 
3103F.8.6 Mooring linelbreasting loads (M). Mooring line and breasting loads can occur simultaneously or individu­ally, depending on the combination of wind and current. Multiple load cases for operating and survival conditions may be required (see Sections 3103F.5.2 and 3105F.2). In addition, loads caused by passing vessels shall be consid­ered for the "mooring and breasting condition." Refer to Sections 3105F.2 and 3/05F.3 for the determination of mooring line and breasting loads. 
3103F.8. 7 Berthing load (B.). Berthing is afrequent occur­rence, and shall be considered as a normal operating load. No increase in allowable stresses shall be applied for ASD.

SECTION 3104F 
SEISMIC ANALYSIS 
AND STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE 

3104F.l General. 
3104F.I.l Purpose. The purpose of this section is to estab­lish minimum standards for seismic analysis and structural performance. Seismic performance is evaluated at two cri­teria levels. Level l requirements define a performance cri­terion to ensure MOT functionality. Level 2 requirements safeguard against major structural damage or collapse. 
3104F.I.2 Applicability. Section 3104F applies to all new and existing MOTs structures. Structures supporting load­ing arms, pipelines, oil transfer and storage equipment, critical nonstructural systems and vessel mooring struc­tures, such as mooring and breasting dolphins are included. Catwalks and similar components that are not part of the lateral load carrying system and do not support oil transfer equipment may be excluded. 
3104F.I.3 Oil spill risk classification. Each existing MOT shall be catagorized into one of three risk classifications (high, medium or low) as shown in Table 31F-4-l, based on the highest of the following: 
1. 	Exposed total volume of oil during transfer ("total volume" as calculated in Section 3108F.2.3) 

2, 	Number of oil transfer operations per berthing system per year 
3. Maximum vessel size (DWT) that may call at the berthing system 
If risk reduction strategies (see Section 3101 F.5) are adopted such that the maximum volume of exposed oil dur­ing transfer is less than 1,200 barrels, the classification level of the facility may be lowered. All new MOTs are clas­sified as high risk. 
3104F.1.4 Configuration classification. Each MOT shall be designated as regular or irregular, in accordance with Figure 31F-4-1. 
Irregular configurations, such as the "T" layout, may be analyzed as regular if the presence of expansion joints divides the T-configuration into two or more regular segments. Expansion joints in this context are defined as joints that sep­arate each structural segment in such a manner that each seg­ment will move independently during an earthquake. 
If an irregular MOT is divided into seismically isolated sections, an evaluation of the relative movement of pipelines 






PIER AND WHARF CONFIGURATIONS 

and supports shall be considered, including phase differ­ences (Section 3109F.3). 
3104F.2 Existing MOTs 
3104F.2.1 Design earthquake motions. Two levels of design seismic performance shall be considered. These lev­els are defined as follows: 
Level l Seismic performance: 
• 	
Minor or no structural damage 

• 	
Temporary or no interruption in operations 


Level 2 Seismic performance: 

• 	
Controlled inelastic structural behavior with repairable damage 

• 	
Prevention of structural collapse 


• 	
Temporary loss of operations, restorable within months 


• 
Prevention of major spill (  1200 bbls) 

31 04F.2.2 Basis for evaluation. Component capacities shall be based on existing conditions, calculated as "best esti­mates," taking into account the mean material strengths, strain hardening and degradation overtime. The capacity of components with little or no ductility, which may lead to brit­tle failure scenarios, shall be calculated based on lower bound material strengths. Methods to establish component strength and deformation capacities for typical structural

materials and components are provided in Section 3107F. Geotechnical considerations are discussed in Section 31 06F. 
31 04F.2.3 Analytical procedures. The objective of the seis­mic analysis is to verify that the displacement capacity of the structure is greater than the displacement demand, for each peiformance level defined in Table 31F-4-2. The required analytical procedures are summarized in Table 3JF-4-3. 
The displacement capacity of the structure shall be calcu­lated using the nonlinear static (pushover) procedure. It is also acceptable to use a nonlinear dynamic procedure for capacity evaluation. Methods used to calculate the dis­placement demand are linear modal, nonlinear static and nonlinear dynamic. 
II Any rational method, subject to the Division 's approval, can be used in lieu of the required analytical procedures shown in Table 31F-4-3. 
31 04F.2.3.1 Nonlinear static capacity procedure (push­over). Two-dimensional nonlinear static (pushover) analyses shall be performed; three-dimensional analy­ses are optional. A model that incorporates the nonlinear load deformation characteristics of all components for the lateral force-resisting system shall be displaced to a target displacement to determine the internal deforma­behavior may be lumped in fewer larger springs, pro­vided that the overall torsional effects are captured. 

Linear material component behavior is acceptable where nonlinear response will not occur. All compo­nents shall be based on effective moment of inertia calculated in accordance with Section 31 07F. Spe­
cific requirements for timber pile structures are dis­cussed in the next section. 

3104F.2.3.1.2 Timber pile supported structures. For all timber pile supported structures, linear elastic procedures may be used. Alternatively, the nonlinear static procedure may be used to estimate the target displacement demand, 11,r 
A simplified single pile model for a typical timber pile supported structure is shown in Figure 3JF-4-2. The pile-deck connections may be assumed to be "pinned." The lateral bracing can often be ignored if it is in poor condition. These assumptions shall be used for the anal­ysis, unless a detailed condition assessment and lateral analysis indicate that the existing bracing and connec­tions may provide reliable lateral resistance. 

tions and forces. The target displacement depends on the 
seismic peiformance level under consideration. Model­
ing details are as follows: 
3104F.2.3.1.1 Modeling. A series of nonlinear push­over analyses may be required depending on the com­plexity of the MOT structure. At a minimum, pushover analysis of a two-dimensional model shall be con­ducted in both the longitudinal and transverse direc­tions. The piles shall be represented by nonlinear elements that capture the moment-curvature/rotation

A series of single pile analyses may be sufficient to establish the nonlinear springs required for the push­over analysis. 
3104F.2.3.1.3 Soil-structure interaction (SSI).

I. Effect of the large difference in up and down slope stiffnesses for wharf type structures 
2. Effect of upper and lower bound soil parame­ters, especially for t-z curves used to model bat­ter pile behavior 

A separate analysis that captures the demand (Section () 3104F.2.3.2) on the piles due to permanent ground deformations, at embanlanents only, shall be performed. 
If a simplified methodology is followed, the piles need to be checked for the following load combinations:

tures, with the exception of irregular configurations with high or moderate seismic risk classifications. The fol­lowing Sections (3104F.2.3.2.1 through 3104F.2.3.4) describe the procedure of Priestly et al. [4.1]; an alter­nate procedure is presented in ATC 40 [4.2], which is improved in FEMA 440 [ 4.3 ]. A linear modal procedure is required for irregular structures with high or moderate seismic risk classifications, and may be used for all other classifications in lieu of the nonlinear static procedure. 3104F.2.3.2.1 Lateral stiffness. The lateral stiffness, k, is calculated from the force-displacement relation as the total base shear, VY' corresponding to the yield dis­placement of the structure a,. /).y is the displacement at first yield in the pile/deck connection reinforcement. 3104F.2.3.2.2 Structural period.

1fT< T0, where T0 is the period corresponding to the peak of the acceleration response spectrum, a refined analysis (see Section 3104F.2.3.2.5) shall be used to calculate the displacement demand. Multidirectional excitation shall be addressed per Section 3104F.4.2. 
3104F.2.3.2.4 Damping. The displacement demand established in Section 3104F.2.3.2.3 is based on 5 percent damping. Higher damping values obtained from a refined analysis may be used to calculate the displacement demand. 
3104F.2.3.2.5 Refined analyses. Refined displacement demand analyses may be calculated as per Chapters 4 and 5 of [4.1] and is briefly summarized below.

3104F.2.3.3 Linear modal demandprocedure. For irregular concrete/steel structures with moderate or high risk classifications, a linear analysis is required to pre­dict the global displacement demands. A 3-D linear elas­tic response analysis shall be used, with effective moment of inertia applied to components to establish lateral dis­placement demands. 


Sufficient modes shall be included in the analysis such that 90 percent of the participating mass is captured in each of the principal horizontal directions for the struc­ture. For modal combinations, the complete quadratic combination rule shall be used. Multidirectional excita­tion shall be accounted for in accordance with Section 3104F.4.2. 
The lateral stiffness of the linear elastic response model shall be based on the initial stiffness of the nonlin­ear pushover curve as shown in Figure 31 F-4-6 (also see Section 3106F.5.1). The p-y springs shall be adjusted based on the secant method approach. Most of the p-y springs will typically be based on their initial stiffness; no iteration is required. 


If the fundamental period in the direction under con­sideration is less than T0, as defined in Section 3104F.2.3.2.3, then the displacement demand shall be amplified as specified in Section 3104F.2.3.2.5. 











3104F.2.3.4 Nonlinear dynamic analysis. Nonlinear dynamic time history analysis is optional, and if per­formed, a peer review is required (see Section 310JF.6. 1 ). Multiple acceleration records shall be used, as explained in Section 3103F.4.2.10. The following assumptions may be made: 
1. 	
Equivalent "super piles" can represent groups of piles. 

2. 	
If the deck has sufficient rigidity (both in-plane and out-of plane) to just{fy its approximation as a rigid element, a 2-D plan simulation may be ade­quate. 


A time-history analysis should always be compared with a simplified approach to ensure that results are rea­sonable. Displacements calculated from the nonlinear time history analyses may be used directly in design, but shall not be less than 80 percent of the values obtained 
from Section 3104F.2.3.2. 
3104F.2.3.5 Alternative procedures. Alternative lat­eral-force procedures using rational analyses based on well-established principles of mechanics may be used in lieu of those prescribed in these provisions. As per Sec­tion 3101F.6.1, peer review is required. 
3104F.3 New MOTs. The analysis and design requirements described in Section 3104F.2 shall also apply to new MOTs. Additional requirements are as follows: 
1. 	
Site-specific response spectra analysis (see Section 3103F.4.2.3). 

2. 	
Soil parameters based on site-specific and new borings (see Section 3106F.2.2). 


3104F.4 General analysis and design requirements. 
3104F.4.1 Load combinations. Earthquake loads shall be used in the load combinations described in Section 3 103F.8. 3104F.4.2 Combination of orthogonal effects. The design 
displacement demand, Aw shall be calculated by combining the longitudinal, A:v and transverse, A,. displacements in the horizontal plane (Figure 31 F-4-7): ·

where: 

A.v = transverse displacement demand e = eccentricity between center of mass and center of rigidity L1 = longitudinal length between wharf expansion 
This equation is only valid for wharf aspect ratios (length/ breadth) greater than 3. 
3104F.4.3 P-A Effects. The P-A effect (i.e., the additional moment induced by the total vertical load multiplied by the lateral deck deflection) shall be considered unless the fol­lowing relationship is satisfied (see Figure 31F-4-8):

connecting adjacent wharf segments, 
vsk• (approximate upper bound to the shear key force [ 4.4]) shall be calculated as follows: 
v,k = 15(ejL1 )VAT (4-I4) 

where:
VAT = total segment lateral force found from a push-over 
analysis
L1 segment length 
= 
e = eccentricity between the center of rigidity and the center of mass 

3104F.4.6 Connections. For an existing wharf, the deterio­rated conditions at the junction between the pile top and pile cap shall be considered in evaluating the moment capacity. Connection detail between the vertical pile and pile cap shall be evaluated to determine whether full or partial moment capacity can be developed under seismic action. 
For new MOTs, the connection details shall develop the full moment capacities. 
The modeling shall simulate the actual moment capacity (full or partial) of the joint in accordance with Section 3107F.2. 7. 
3104F.4. 7 Batter piles. Batter piles primarily respond to earthquakes by developing large axial compression or ten­sion forces. Bending moments are generally of secondary importance. Failure in compression may be dictated by the deck-pile connection (most common type), material com­pression, buckling, or by excessive local shear in deck mem­bers adjacent to the batter pile. Failure in tension may be dictated by connection strength or by pile pull out. (p. 3-83 of{4.4]). 
When the controlling failure scenario is reached and the batter pile fails, the computer model shall be adjusted to consist of only the vertical pile acting either as a full or par­tial moment frame based on the connection details between the pile top and pile cap. The remaining displacement capacity, involving vertical piles, before the secondary fail­ure stage develops, shall then be established (see Section 3107F.2.8). 
Axial p-z curves shall be modeled. In compression, dis­placement capacity should consider the effect of the reduc­tion in pile modulus of elasticity at high loads and the increase in effective length for friction piles. This proce­dure allows the pile to deform axially before reaching ulti­mate loads, thereby increasing the displacement ductility [4.4]. 
Horizontal nonlinear p-y springs are only applied to bat­ter piles with significant embedment, such as for landside batter piles in a wharf structure. Moment fixity can be assumed for batter piles that extend well above the ground 
such as waterside batter piles in a wharf structure or batter piles in a pier type structure. 
3104F.5 Nonstructural components. This section covers nonstructural components having a significant mass and/or a critical importance to the operability and safety of the MOT. The weight of nonstructural components shall be included in the dead load of the structure, per Section 3I03F.2. 
3104F.5.1 Contribution to global response. Nonstructural components including, but not limited to pipelines, loading arms, raised platforms, control rooms and vapor control equipment, may affect the global structural response. In such cases, the seismic characteristics (mass and/or stiffness) of the nonstructural components shall be considered. Ifthe seis­mic response of nonstructural components is out of phase with the global structural response, then the mass contribu­tion can be neglected in the seismic structural analysis. 
3104F.5.2 Seismic loads. In general, for nonstructural components, the evaluation procedures of Section 3IJOF.8 are adequate. 
For pipelines, the seismic analysis shall be performed in accordance with Section 3109F.3, in lieu of Section 3IJOF.8. /f a pipeline analysis has been performed and sup-II port reactions are available, they may be used to determine the forces on the support structure. 
A pipeline segment under consideration shall extend between two adjacent anchor points. A simplified pipeline analysis may be used when the relative displacement demands of anchor points are considered. As an option, a 
full nonlinear time-history analysis can be used to capture the nonlinear interaction between the structure and the pipeline. 
3104F.5.3 Nonstructural critical systems assessment. A seismic assessment of the survivability and continued oper­ation during a Levell earthquake (see Table 3I F -4-2) shall be performed for critical systems. such as fire protection, emergency shutdown and electrical power systems. The assessment shall consider the adequacy and condition of anchorage, flexibility and seismically-induced interaction. For existing systems, seismic adequacy may be assessed per [4.5].

SECTION 3105F MOORING AND BERTHING ANALYSIS AND DESIGN 
3105F.l General. 
31 OSF.l.l Purpose.This section establishes minimum stan­dards for safe mooring and berthing of vessels at MOTs. 
3105F.1.2 Applicability. This section applies to onshore MOTs; Figure31F-5-1 showstypicalpierandwhaifconfig­urations. 

FIGURE 31F-5-1 TYPICAL PIER AND WHARF CONFIGURATIONS 

>II 	3105F.I.3 Mooring/berthing requirements. Multiple berth MOTs shall use the same conditions for each berth unless it can be demonstrated that there are significant differences. 
> 	MOTs shall have the following equipment in operation: 
1. 
An anemometer (NIE). 


2. 
A current meter in high velocity current (> 1.5 knots) > areas (NIE). 

3. 
Remote reading tension load devices in high velocity current (> 1.5 knots) areas and/or with passing vessel effects for new MOTs. 

4. 
Mooring hardware in 	accordance with Section 3103F.10 (N/E). 



Berthing systems shall be in accordance with Section 3105F.4 (N/E). 

> 

3105F.1.4 New MOTs. Quick release hooks are required at all new MOTs, except for spring line fittings. Quick release hooks shall be sized in accordance with Section 31 03F.JO. To avoid accidental release, the freeing mechanism shall be acti­vated by a two-step process. Quick release hooks shall be 
II 
II insulated electrically from the mooring structure, and shall be supported so as not to contact the deck. 
Section 31 05F.5 and the OCIMF guidelines [ 5.4] shall be 
used in designing the mooring layout. 
3105F.1.5 Analysis and design of mooring components. 
The existing condition of the MOT shall be used in the moor­ing analysis (see Section 31 02F ). Structural characteristics 

512 
of the MOT, including type and configuration of mooring 
fittings such as bollards, bitts, hooks and capstans and 
material properties and condition, shall be determined in 
accordance with Sections 3107F.4 and 3103F.IO. 

The analysis and design of mooring components shall be 
based on the loading combinations and safety factors 
defined in Sections 3103F.8 through 3103F.JO, and in 
accordance with ACI 318 [5.1], AJSC [5.2] and 
ANSIIAF&PA NDS [5.3], as applicable. 


3105F.2 Mooring analyses. A mooring analysis shall be per­formed for each berthing system, to justify the safe berthing of the various deadweight capacities of vessels expected at the MOT. The forces acting on a moored vessel shall be determined in accordance with Section 31 03F.5. Mooring line and breasting load combinations shall be in accordance with Section 31 03F. 8. 


Two procedures, manual and numerical are available for peiforming mooring analyses. These procedures shall conform to either the OCIMF document, "Mooring Equipment Guide­lines (MEG3)" [5.4] or the Department of Defense "Moor­ings" document [5.5]. The manual procedure (Section 3105F.2.1) may be used for barges. 
A new mooring assessment shall be peiformed when condi­tions change, such as any modification in the mooring configu­ration, vessel size or new information indicating greater wind, current or other environmental loads. 
()

In general, vessels shall remain in contact with the breasting or fendering system. ssel motion (sway) of up to 2 feet off the breasting structure may be allowed under the most severe envi­ronmental loads, unless greater movement can be justified by an appropriate mooring analysis that accounts for potential dynamic effects. The allowable movement shall be consistent with mooring analysis results, indicating that forces in the moor­ing lines and their supports are within the allowable safety fac­tors. Also, a check shall be made as to whether the movement is within the limitations of the cargo transfer equipment. 
The most severe combination of the environmental loads has to be identified for each mooring component. At a minimum, the following conditions shall be considered: 
1. 
Two current directions (maximum ebb and flood; See 
Section 3103F.5.3) 


2. 
Two tide levels (highest high and lowest low) 

3. 
Two vessel loading conditions (ballast and maximum 
draft at the terminal) 


4. 
Eight wind directions (45 degree increments) 




3105F.2.1 Manual procedure. Simplified calculations may 
be used to determine the mooring forces for barges with 
Favorable site conditions (see Table 31F-3-10) and no 
passing vessel effects (see Section 3105R3.2), except if any 
of the following conditions exist (Figures 31F-5-2 and 
31F-5-3, below). 



1. 
Mooring layout is significantly asymmetrical 

2. 
Horizontal mooring line angles (a) on bow and stem exceed 45 degrees

3. 	
Horizontal breast mooring line angles exceed 15 nor­mal to the hull 

4. 	
Horizontal spring mooring line angles exceed 10 degrees from a line parallel to the hull

sis (See Section 3103F.5.4) is required. The wave period shall be established based on a ]-year significant wave height, H.r For MOTs within a harbor basin, the wave period shall be based on the locally generated waves with relatively short fetch. 
3105F.3.2 Passing vessels. These forces generated by pass­ing vessels are due to pressure gradients associated with the flow pattern. These pressure gradients cause the moored vessel to sway, surge, and yaw, thus imposing forces on the mooring lines. 
Passing vessel analysis shall be conducted when all of the following conditions exist (See Figure 31F-5-4): 
1. 	
Passing vessel size is greater than 25,000 DWT. II 

2. 
Distance L is 500 feet or less 

3. 	
Vessel speed Vis greater than Vcrir 




where:

Exception: If L .s; 2B, passing vessel loads shall be

considered. 

LandB are shown in Figure 3JF-5-4, in units of feet. Vis defined as the speed of vessel over land minus the current velocity, when traveling with the current, or the speed of vessel over land plus the current velocity, when traveling against the current. 



and stern 
When the forces have been determined and the distance between the bow and stern mooring points is known, the yaw moment can be resolved into lateral loads at the bow and stern. The total environmental loads on a moored vessel are comprised of the lateral load at the vessel bow, the lat­eral load at the vessel stern and the longitudinal load. Line pretension loads must be added. 
Four load cases shall be considered: 
1. 	
Entire load is taken by mooring lines 

2. 	
Entire load is taken by breasting structures 

3. 
Load is taken by combination of mooring lines and breasting structures 




FIGURE 31 F-5-4 


4. Longitudinal load is taken only by spring lines 
3105F.2.2 Numerical procedure. A numerical procedure is required to obtain mooring forces for MOTs that cannot use manual procedure. Computer program(s) shall be based on mooring analysis procedures that consider the characteris­tics of the mooring system, calculate the environmental loads and provide resulting mooring line forces and vessel motions (surge and sway). 
3105F.3 Wave, passing vessel, seiche and tsunami. 
3105F.3.1 Wind waves. MOTs are generally located in shel­tered waters such that typical wind waves can be assumed not to affect the moored vessel if the significant wave period, T., is less than 4 seconds. However, if the period is equal to or greater than 4 seconds, then a simplified dynamic analy-
PASSING VESSEL 

When such conditions (1, 2 and 3 above) exist, the surge and sway forces and the yaw moment acting on the moored vessel shall, as a minimum, be established in accordance with Section 3103F.5.5 or by dynamic analysis. 
For MOTs located in ports, the passing distance, L, may be established based on channel width and vessel traffic patterns. The guidelines established in the Department of Defense, UFC 4-150-06, Figure 5-17 [5.6] for interior channels may be used. The "vertical bank" in Figure 5-17 of [5.6] shall be replaced by the side of the moored vessel when establishing the distance, "L ." 


BUFF 

For Mars, not located within a port, the distance, "L, 
" must be determined from observed traffic patterns. 
The following passing vessel positions shall be investi­gated: 
I. 	Passing vessel is centered on the moored ship. This position produces maximum sway force. 
2. 	The midship of the passing vessel is fore or aft of the centerline of the moored ship by a distance of 0.40 times the length of the moored ship. This position is assumed to produce maximum surge force and yaw moment at the same time. 

The mooring loads due to a passing vessel shall be added to the mooring loads due to wind and current. 
3105F.3.3 Seiche. A seiche analysis is required for existing MOTs located within a harbor basin and which have histor­ically experienced seiche. A seiche analysis is required for new Mars inside a harbor basin prone to penetration of ocean waves. 
The standing wave system or seiche is characterized by a series of "nodes " and "antinodes." Seiche typically has wave periods ranging from 20 seconds up to several hours, with wave heights in the range of0.1 to 0.4 ft [5.6]. 
The following procedure may be used, as a minimum, in evaluating the effects of seiche within a harbor basin. In more complex cases where the assumptions below are not applicable, dynamic methods are required. 
1. 	
Calculate the natural period of oscillation of the basin. The basin may be idealized as rectangular, closed or open at the seaward end. Use Chapter 2 of UFC 4-150-06 [5.6] to calculate the wave period and length for different modes. The first three modes shall be considered in the analysis. 

2. 	
Determine the location of the moored ship with respect to the antinode and node of the first three modes to determine the possibility of resonance. 

3. 	
Determine the natural period of the vessel and moor­ing system. The calculation shall be based on the total mass of the system and the stiffness of the mooring lines in surge. The surge motion of the moored vessel is estimated by analyzing the vessel motion as a har­monically forced linear single degree of freedom spring mass system. Methods outlined in a paper by 



F.A. Kilner [5. 7] can be used to calculate the vessel motion. 
4. 	Vessels are generally berthed parallel to the chan­nel; therefore, only longitudinal (surge) motions shall be considered, with the associated mooring loads in the spring lines. The loads on the mooring lines (spring lines) are then determined from the computed vessel motion and the stiffness of those mooring lines. 

3105F.3.4 Tsunami. Run-up and current velocity shall be considered in the tsunami assessment. Table 31F-3-8 pro­vides run-up values for the San Francisco Bay area, Los Angeles/Long Beach Harbors and Port Hueneme. 





3105F.4 Berthing analysis and design. The analysis and design of berthing components shall be based on the loading combinations and safety factors defined in Sections 3103F.8 and 3103F.9 and in accordance with ACI 318 [5.1], AISC [5.2], and ANSI/AF&PA NDS [5.3], as applicable. 
3105F.4.1 Berthing energy demand. The kinetic berthing energy demand shall be determined in accordance with Sec­tion 3103F.6. 
3105F.4.2 Berthing energy capacity. For existing MOTs, the berthing energy capacity shall be calculated as the area under the force-deflection curve for the combined structure and fender system as indicated in Figure 31F-5-5. Fender piles may be included in the lateral analysis to establish the total force-deflection curve for the berthing system. Load­deflection curves for other fender types shall be obtained from manufacturer 's data. The condition offenders shall be taken into account when performing the analysis. 
When batter piles are present, the fender system typically absorbs most of the berthing energy. This can be established by comparing the force-deflection curves for the fender sys­tem and batter piles. In this case only the fender system energy absorption shall be considered. 





FIGURE 31 F-5-5 BERTHING ENERGY CAPACITY 

3105F.4.3 Tanker contact length. 

3105F.4.3.1 Continuous fender system. A continuous fender system consists of fender piles, chocks, wales, and rubber or spring fender units. 
The contact length of a ship during berthing depends on the spacing of the fender piles and fender units, and the connection details of the chocks and wales to the 
fender piles. 
The contact length, Lc can be approximated by the 
chord formed by the curvature of the bow and the berth­ing angle as shown in Equation 5-2 below.

Lc = contact length 
r = Bow radius

In lieu of detailed analysis to determine the contact length, Table 31F-5-1 may be used. The contact length

3105R4.3.2 Discrete fender system. For discrete fender systems (i.e., not continuous), one fender unit or breast­ing dolphin shall be able to absorb the entire berthing energy. 
3105R4.4 Longitudinal and vertical berthing forces. 
The longitudinal and vertical components of the hori­zontal berthing force shall be calculated using appropri­ate coefficients of friction between the vessel and the fender. In lieu of as-built data, the values in Table 31 F-5-2 may be used for typical fender/vessel materials:

Urethane to Steel  0.4 to 0. 6  
Steel to Steel  0.25  
Rubber to Steel  0. 6 to 0. 7  
UHMW* to Steel  0. 1 to 0.2  

*Ultra-high molecular weight plastic rubbing strips. 
Longitudinal and vertical forces shall be determined by: 
F= !JN 	(5-3) 
where: 
F = 	longitudinal or vertical component of horizon­tal berthing force 
1J = coefficient of friction of contact materials N = maximum horizontal berthing force (normal to fender) 
31 05R4.5 Design and selection of new fender systems. For guidelines on new fender designs, refer to the Department of Defense "Piers and Wharves " document (UFC 4-152-01) 
[5.8] and the PIANC Guidelines for the Design of Fenders Systems: 2002 [5.9]. Also see Section 3103F.6. 
3105R5 Layout of new MOTs. The number and spacing of independent mooring dolphins and breasting dolphins depends on the DWT and length overall (LOA) of vessels to be accommodated. 
Breasting dolphins shall be positioned adjacent to the paral­lel body of the vessel when berthed. A minimum of two breast­ing dolphins shall be provided. The spacing of breasting dolphins shall be adequate for all sizes of vessels that may berth at the MOT. 




MARINE OIL TERMINALS 
Mooring dolphins shall be set back from the berthing line (fender line) for a distance between 115ft and 165ft, so that longer bow, stem and breast lines can be deployed. 
For a preliminary layout, the guidelines in the British Stan­dards, Part 4, Section 2 [ 5. 10 }, may be used in conjunction with the guidelines below. 
1. 	
are provided, the spacing between exterior breasting dolphins shall be between 0.3 and 0.4 LOA of the maximum sized vessel expected to call at the MOT. The spacing between interior breasting dolphins shall be approximately 0.3 to 0.4LOA of the minimum sized vessel expected to call at the MOT. 


2. 	
If only are provided, the spacing between the dolphins shall be the smaller (0.3LOA) of the guidelines specified above. 


3. If bow and stern lines are used for mooring, the spacing between be 1.35 times the LOA of the maximum sized vessel expected to call at the MOT. 


4. 	The spacing between 
shall be 
0.8 times the LOA of the maximum sized vessel expected to call at the MOT. 
The final layout of the mooring and breasting dolphins shall be determined based on the results of the mooring analysis that provides optimal mooring line and breasting forces for the range of vessels to be accommodated. The breasting force under the mooring condition shall not exceed the maximum fender reaction of the fender unit when it is being compressed at the manufacturers rated deflection.

SECTION 3106F GEOTECHNICAL HAZARDS AND FOUNDATIONS 
3106F.l General. 

0 
3106F.l.l Purpose. This section provides minimum stan­dards for analyses and evaluation of geotechnical hazards 
and foundations. 
3106F.l.2 Applicability. The requirements provided herein apply to all new and existing MOTs. 

0 
3106F.1.3 Seismic loading. The seismic loading for geotechnical hazard assessment and foundation analyses is provided in Section 3103F.4. 
3106F.2 Site characterization. 
3106F.2.1 Site classes. Each MOT shall be assigned at least one site class, based on site-specific geotechnical informa­tion. Site Classes SA, SB, S0 SD, and SE are defined in Table 31F-6-1 and Site Class SF is defined as follows: 

1. 
Soils vulnerable to significant potential loss of stiff­ness, strength, and/or volume under seismic loading, such as liquefiable soils, quick and highly sensitive clays, and collapsible weakly cemented soils. 

2. 
Peats and/or highly organic clays, where the thick­ness of peat or highly organic clay exceeds 10 feet. 



3. 
Very high plasticity clays with a plasticity index (PI) greater than 75, where depth of clay exceeds 25feet. 

4. 
Very thick soft/medium stiff clays, where the depth of clay exceeds 120 feet. 



3106F.2.2 Site-specific information. In general, geotechni­cal characterization shall be based on site-specific informa­tion. This information may be obtained from existing or new sources. However, if existing or nonsite specific information is used, the geotechnical engineer of record shall provide adequate justification for its use. 
Site-specific investigations shall include, at a minimum, bor­

ings and/or cone penetration tests, soil classifications, cmifig­
uration, foundation loading and an assessment of seismic 



hazards. The array (number and depths) of exploratory borings and cone penetration tests (CPT) will depend on the proposed or existing structures and site stratigraphy. The investigation or testing activities shall be completed following the procedures in Section 5 ofSCEC [6.3 ]. CPT data may also be used by first converting to standard penetration test (SPT) data, using an appropriate method, that reflects the effects of soil gradation. If geotechnical data other than SPT and CPT are used, an adequate explanation andrationale shall be provided. 
Quantitative soil information is required to a depth of 100 feet below the mudline, for assigning a Site Class (see Table 31 F-6-1 ). When data to a depth of 100 feet is unavailable, other information such as geologic considerations may be used to determine the Site Class. 
3106F.3 Liquefaction. A liquefaction asse$sment shall 
address triggering and the resulting hazards, using residual 
shear strengths of liquefied soils. 
3106F.3.1 Triggering assessment. Liquefaction triggering shall be expressed in terms of the factor of safety (SF): 
SF =CRRjCSR (6-1) 
where: 

CRR = Cyclic Resistance Ratio CSR = The Cyclic Stress Ratio induced by Design Peak Ground Acceleration (DPGA) or other postu­lated shaking 
The CRR shall be determined from Figure 7.1 in SCEC 
[6.3 ]. If available, both the SPT and CPT data can be used. 


CSR shall be evaluated using the simplified procedure in Section 3106F.3.1.1 or site-specific response analysis pro­cedures in Section 3106F.3.1.2. 
Shaking-induced shear strength reductions in liquefiable materials are determined as follows: 
1. SF> 1.4 

Reductions of shear strength for the materials for postearthquake conditions may be neglected. 







2. 1.0 <SF< 1.4 

A strength value intermediate to the material's initial strength and residual undrained shear strength should be selected based on the level of residual excess pore water pressure expected to be generated by the ground shaking (e.g., Figure 10 of Seed and Harder, [6.4]). 
3. SFS1.0 
Reduction of the material shear strength to a residual undrained shear strength level shall be considered, as described in Section 3106F.3.2. 
3106F.3.1.1 Simplified procedure. The simplified pro­cedure to evaluate liquefaction triggering shall follow Section 7 ofSCEC [6.3 1. Cyclic stress ratio ( CSR) is used to define seismic loading, in terms of the Design Peak 
Ground Acceleration (DPGA) and Design Earthquake Magnitude (DEM). DPGA and DEM are addressed in 
Section 3103F.4.2. CSR is defined as: 
CSR = 

(6-2) 
where: 
g = gravitational constant 
o. = the vertical total stress 
o'. = the vertical effective stress 
rd = a stress reduction factor 
rMsF = the magnitude scaling factor 
For values ofrMsF and rd> see SCEC [6.3 1 Figures 7.2 and 7.3, respectively. To evaluate rMsF> the DEM value associated with DPGA shall be used. 
3106F.3.1.2 Site specific response procedure. In lieu of the simplified procedure, either one-dimensional or two-dimensional site response analysis may be per­formed using the ground motion parameters discussed in Section 31 03F.4. The computed cyclic stresses at various points within the pertinent soil layers shall be expressed 
as values of CSR. 

3106F.3.2 Residual strength. The residual undrained shear strength may be estimated from Figure 7.7 of SCEC [6.31. When necessary, a conservative extrapolation of the range should be made. Under no circumstances, shall the residual shear strength be higher than the shear strength based on effective strength parameters. 
The best estimate value should correspond to %from the lower bound of the range for a given value of equivalent clean sand SPT blowcount. When a value other than the "% value " is selected for the residual shear strength, the selec­tion shall be justified. An alternate method is provided in Stark and Mesri [6.51. The residual strength of liquefied soils may be obtained as a function of effective confining pressures if a justification is provided. The resulting resid­ual shear strength shall be used as the postearthquake shear strength of liquefied soils. 






3106F.4 Other geotechnical hazards. For a SF less than 1.4, the potential for the following hazards shall be evaluated: 
1. 
Flow slides 

2. 
Slope movements 

3. 
Lateral spreading 

4. 
Ground settlement and differential settlement 

5. 
Other surface manifestations 


These hazards shall be evaluated, using the residual shear strength described above (Section 3106F.3.2). 
3106F.4.1 Stabilityof earth structures.Ifa slope failure could affect the M OT, a stability analysis of slopes and earth retaining structures shall be performed. The analysis shall use limit equilibrium methods that satisfy all of the force and/or moment equilibrium conditions and determine the slope stability safety factor. 
1. Slope stability safety factor  1.2 


Flow slides can be precluded; however, seismically induced ground movements shall be addressed. 
2. 1.0 S Slope stability safety factor < 1.2 
Seismically induced ground movements should be evalu­ated using the methods described below. 
3. Slope stability safety factor< 1.0 
Mitigation measures shall be implemented per Section 3106F.6. 
31 06F.4.2 Simplified ground movement analysis. The seis­mically induced ground settlement may be estimated using Section 7.6 ofSCEC [6.31. Surface manifestation of lique­faction may be evaluated using Section 7. 7 ofSCEC. 
Results shall be evaluated to determine if mitigation measures are required. 
Seismically induced deformation or displacement of slopes shall be evaluated using the Makdisi-Seed [6.61 sim­plified method as described below. 
The stability analysis shall be used with the residual shear strengths of soils to estimate the yield acceleration coeffi­cient, KY' associated with the critical potential movement plane. In general, the DPGA shall be used as Kmax (see [6.61) and DEMas the earthquake magnitude, M. These parame­ters shall be used together with the upper bound curves Fig­ures 9-11 of [6.61, to estimate the seismically induced ground movement along.the critical plane. 
However, the value of Kmax may be different from the DPGA value to include the effects of amplification, incoher­ence, etc. When such adjustments are made in converting DPGA to KmaxJ a justification shall be provided. Linear interpolation using the upper bound curves in Figure 10 (ordinate scale should be divided by 10) in [6.61 or Figure 4-10 in Ferritto et al [ 6. 71 can be used to estimate the seis­mically induced ground movement for other earthquake magnitudes. 
For the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, Newmark displacement curves are available and are site-specific

[3.5, 3.6]. CurvesareprovidedforbothLevell andLevel2 earthquakes, and plot yield acceleration versus lateral dis­placement. 
For screening purposes only, lateral spreading shall be evaluated, using the simplified equations in Youd et al. [6.8]. The total seismically induced ground displacement shall include all contributory directions. 
1. 	
When the resulting displacement from the screening method is > 0.1 ft., the Makdisi-Seed simplified method or other similar methods shall be used to esti­mate lateral spreading. 

2. 
If the computed displacement from the simplified method( s) is ::;; 0.5 ft., the effects can be neglected. 

3. 
If the computed displacements using simplified meth­ods are > 0.5ft., the use of a detailed ground move­ment analysis (see Section 31 06F.4.3) may be considered. 

4. 
If the final resulting displacement, regardless of the method used, remains > 0.5 ft., it shall be considered in the structural analysis. 


3106F.4.3 Detailedground movement analysis. As an alternative to the simplified methods discussed above, a two-dimensional (2-D) equivalent linear or nonlinear dynamic analysis of the MOT and/or slopes and earth retaining systems may be performed. 
An equivalent linear analysis is adequate when the stiff­ness and/or strength of the soils involved are likely to degrade by less than one-third, during seismic excitation of less than 0.5 g's. Appropriate time histories need to be obtained to calculate seismically induced displacement (see Section 31 03R4.2 ). Such analysis should account for the accumulating effects of displacement if double-integration of acceleration time histories is used. The seismic stresses or stress time histories from equivalent linear analysis may be used to estimate seismically induced deformation. 
A nonlinear analysis should be used if the stiffness and/or strength of the soils involved are likely to degrade by more than one-third during seismic motion. 
If the structure is included in the analysis, the ground motion directly affects the structural response. Otherwise, the uncoupled, calculated movement of the soil on the struc­ture shall be evaluated. 
31 06F.5 Soil structure interaction. Two separate loading con­ditions for the piles shall be considered: ( 1) Inertial loading under seismic conditions, and (2) Kinematic loading from lat­eral ground spreading. Inertial loading is associated with earthquake-induced lateral loading on a structure, while kine­matic loading refers to loading on foundation piles from earth­quake induced lateral deformations of the slope/ embankment/dike system. Simultaneous application of these loading conditions shall be evaluated with due consideration of the phasing and locations of these loads on foundation ele­ments. The foundation design shall meet the structural perfor-

MARINE OIL TERMINALS 
mance requirements of this Code, when subjected to both iner­tial and kinematic loadings. 
3106F.5.1 Soil parameters. Soil structure interaction (SSI) shall be addressed for the seismic evaluation of MOT struc­tures. SSI may consist of linear or non-linear springs (and possibly dash-pots) for various degrees of freedom, includ­ing horizontal, vertical, torsional, and rotational, as required by the structural analysis. 


Pile capacity parameters may be evaluated using the pro­cedures in Chapter4 ofFEMA 356 [6.9]. The "p-y" curves, "t-z" curves, and tip load -displacement curves for piles (nonlinear springs for horizontal and vertical modes and nonlinear vertical springs for the pile tip, respectively) and deep foundations shall be evaluated using Section 6 of API RP 2A-WSD [6.10] including the consideration of pile group effects. Equivalent springs (and dashpots) represent­ing the degrading properties of soils may be developed. 
Where appropriate, alternative procedures can be used to develop these parameters. Rationale for the use of alterna­tive procedures shall be provided. One simplified method is presented in Chapter 4 of the UFC 3-220-01A [6.11] and provides deflection and moment for an isolated pile, subject to a lateral load. 
3106F.5.2 Shallow foundations. Shallow foundations shall be assumed to move with the ground. Springs and dashpots may be evaluated as per Gazetas [6. 12]. 
3106F.5.3 Underground structures. Buried flexible struc­tures or buried portions of flexible structures including piles and pipelines shall be assumed to deform with estimated ground movement at depth. 
As the soil settles, it shall be assumed to apply shear forces to buried structures or buried portions of structures including deep foundations. 
3106R6 Mitigation measures and alternatives. If the hazards and consequences addressed in Sections 3106R3 and 3106R4 are beyond the specified range, the following options shall be considered: 
1. 
Perform a more sophisticated analysis 

2. 
Modify the structure 

3. 
Modify the foundation soil 



Examples of possible measures to modify foundation soils are provided in Table 4-1 of [6.7].

SECTION 3107F 
STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS AND 
DESIGN OF COMPONENTS 

3107F.l General. 


3107F.l.l Purpose.This section establishes the minimum performance standards for structural components. Evalua­tion procedures for seismic performance, strength and deformation characteristics of concrete, steel and timber components are prescribed herein.

sion, concrete spalling, cracking and chemical attack 
10.

MARINE OIL TERMINALS 
3107F.2.1.1 Material properties. Material properties of existing components, not determined from testing proce­dures, and of new components, shall be established using the following methodology. 
The strength of structural components shall be evalu­ated based on the following values (Section 5.3 of [7.1] andpp. 3-73 and 3-74 of [7.2]): 
Specified material strength shall be used for nonduc­tile components (shear controlled), all mechanical, elec­trical and mooring equipment (attachments to the deck) and for all non seismic load combinations: (7-1a) (7-1b) (7-1c) 


In addition, these values (7-1a, 7-1b and 7-1c) may be used conservatively as alternatives to determine the nominal strength of ductile components (N). 
Expected lower bound estimates of material strength shall be used for determination of moment-curvature relations and nominal strength of all ductile compo­nents: 
f =1.3f (7-2a) fy = 1.1/y (7-2b) /p = 1.0/p (7-2c) 
Upper bound estimates of material strength shall be used for the determination of moment-curvature rela­tions, to obtain the feasible maximum demand on capac­ity protected members: 
f = 1.7fc 	(7-3a) 
fy = 1.3/y 	(7-3b) 
/p = 1.1/p 	(7-3c) 
where: 
fc = Specified compressive strength of concrete 

[y = Specified yield strength of reinforcement or 
specified minimum yield stress steel 
:{p = Specified yield strength of prestress strands 

"Capacity Design " (Section 5.3 of[7.1]) ensures that the strength at protected components (such as pile caps and decks), joints and actions (such as shear), is greater than the maximum feasible demand (over strength), based on realistic upper bound estimates of plastic hinge flexural strength. An additional series of nonlinear anal­yses using moment curvature characteristics of pile hinges may be required. 
Alternatively, if a moment-curvature analysis is per­formed that takes into account the strain hardening of the steel, the demands used to evaluate the capacity pro­tected components may be estimated by multiplying the moment-curvature values by 1.25. 
2013 CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE 




Based on a historical review of the building materials used in the twentieth century, guidelines for tensile and yield properties of concrete reinforcing bars and the com­pressive strength of structural concrete have been estab­lished (see Tables 6-1 to 6-3 ofFEMA 356 [7.3 ]. The values shown in these tables can be used as default properties, only if as-built information is not available and testing is not performed. The values in Tables 31F-7-1 and 31F-7-2, are adjusted according to equations (7-1) through (7-3). 
31 07R2.1.2 Knowledge factor (k).Knowledge factor, k, shall be applied on a component basis. 
The following information is required, at a minimum, for a component strength assessment: 
1. Original construction records, including draw­ings and specifications. 


2. 
A set of "as-built" drawings and/or sketches, doc­umenting both gravity and lateral systems (Section 31 02F.1.5) and any postconstruction modification data. 

3. 
A visual condition survey, for structural compo­nents including identification of the size, location and connections of these components. 

4. 
In the absence of material properties, values from limited in-situ testing or conservative estimates of materialproperties(Tables31F-7-l and31F-7-2). 

5. 
Assessment of component conditions, from an in­situ evaluation, including any observable deterio­ration. 


6. 
Detailed geotechnical information, based on ()recent test data, including risk of liquefaction, lat­eral spreading and slope stability.

If expected lower bound of material strength Section 3107F.2.1.1 Equations (7-2a, 7-2b, 7-2c) are used in obtaining the nominal shear strength, a new nonlinear analysis utilizing the upper bound estimate of material strength Section 31 07F.2.1.1 Equations (7-3a, 7-3b, 7-3c) shall be used to obtain the plastic hinge shear demand. An alternative conservative approach is to multiply the maximum shear demand, Vmax

As an alternative, the method of Kowalski and Priestley [7. 7] may be used. Their method is based on a three-parameter model with separate contributions to shear strength from concrete (V J, transverse reinforce­ment (V,), and axial load (Vp) to obtain nominal shear strength (V J:

3107F.2.8 Batter piles. 
3107F.2.8.1 Existing ordinary batter piles. Wharves or piers with ordinary (not fused, plugged or having a seis­mic release mechanism) batter piles typically have a very stiff response when subjected to lateral loads in the direction of the batter. The structure often maintains most of its initial stiffness all the way to failure of the first 
row of batter piles. Since batter piles most likely will fail under a Level 2 seismic event, the following method may be used to evaluate the post-failure behavior of the wharf or pier: 

1. 
Identify the failure mechanism of the batter pile-deck connection (refer to Section 31 04F.4. 7) for typical failure scenarios) and the correspond­ing lateral displacement. 

2. 
Release the lateral load between the batter pile and the deck when the lateral failure displacement is reached. 

3. 
Push on the structure until subsequent failure( s)have been identified. 



As an example, following these. steps will result in a force-displacement (pushover) curve similar to the one shown in Figure 31F-7-14 for ti wharf supported by one row of batter piles. 
Displacement 
FIGURE 31 F-7-14 PUSHOVER CURVE FOR ORDINARY BATTER PILES 

When the row of batter piles fail in tension or shear, stored energy will be released. The structure will therefore experience a lateral displacement demand following the nonductile pile failures. If the structure can respond to this displacement demand without exceeding other structurallimita­


529
2013 CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE 

MARINE OIL TERMINALS 




tions, it may be assumed that the structure is stable and will start to respond to further shaking with a much longer period and corresponding lower seis­mic demands. The whaif structure may therefore be able to sustain larger seismic demands follow­ing the loss of the batter piles than before the loss of pile capacity, because of a much softer seismic response. 
The area under the pushover curve before the batter pile failures is compared to the equivalent area under the post failure pushover curve (refer to Figure 3IF-7-14). If no other structural limita­tions are reached with the new displacement demand, it is assumed that the structure is capable of absorbing the energy. It should be noted that even though the shear failure is nonductile, it is expected that energy will be absorbed and the 

damping will increase during the damage of the piles. The above method is, therefore, considered conservative. 
Following the shear failure of a batter pile row, the period of the structure increases such that equal displacement can be assumed when estimat­
ing the post-failure displacement demand. The new period may be estimated from the initial stiff­ness of the post-failure system as shown in Figure 31F-7-14. A new displacement demand can then be calculated in accordance with Section 31 04F.2. 

3107F.2.8.2 Nonordinary Batter Piles. For the case of a plugged batter pile system, an appropriate displacement force relationship considering plug friction may be used in modeling the structural system. 
For fused and seismic release mechanism batter pile systems, a nonlinear modeling procedure shall be used and peer reviewed (Section 3101F.6.1).

Use the pro­cedure of Section 31 07F.2.5. 7 to establish the over strength demand of the plastic hinges. Component capacity shall be based on nominal material strengths, and reduction factors according to ACI-318 [7.5].

The minimum concrete cover for prestressed con­crete piles shall be three inches, unless corrosion inhibitors are used, in which case a cover of two-and-one-half inches is acceptable. 

3. 
The minimum concrete cover for whaifbeams and slabs, and all concrete placed against soil shall be three inches, except for headed reinforcing bars (pile dowels or shear stirrups) the cover may be reduced to two-and-one-half inch cover at the top suiface only. If corrosion inhibitors are used, a cover of two-and-one-half inches is acceptable.

The adjusted design stress values in the ANSI/AF&PA NDS [7.9] may be used as default values by replacing the Format Conversion Factor of ANSI/AF&PA NDS [7.9] with the factor 2.8 divided by the Resistance Fac­tor (Table Nl [7.9 ]).

3108F.2.3 Cargo liquid and fire hazard classifications (NIE). The cargo liquid hazard classes are defined in Table 31F-8-J, as either High (He) or Low (Lc), depending on the flash point. Fire hazard classifications (Low, Medium or High) are defined in Table 31F-8-2, and are based on the cargo liquid hazard class and the sum of all stored and flowing volumes, prior to the emergency shut down system (ESD) stopping the flow of oil. 
The stored volume is the sum of the He and Lc liquid hazard class piping volumes (V SH and V sJ, if the piping is not stripped. 

During a pipeline leak, a quantity of oil is assumed to spill at the maximum cargo flow rate until the ESD is fully effective. 
The ESD valve closure is required to be completed in 60 sec­onds if installed prior to November 1, 1980 or in 30 seconds if

If the struc­ture's seismic performance as required by Section 3417.5 is evaluated as satisfactory and the peer reviewer(s), when Method B of Section 3421 is used, concur, then no structural retrofit is required. 
3417.5 Minimum seismic design peiformance levels for struc­tural and nonstructural components. Following the notations of ASCE 41, the seismic requirements for design and assessment are based upon a prescribed Earthquake Hazard Level (BSE-1, BSE-2, BSE-R or ESE-C), a specified structural performance level (S-1 through S-5) and a non-structural performance level (N-A through N-E). The minimum seismic performance criteria 
II Authority and theRisk Category as determined in Chapter 16 or are given in Table 3417.5 according to the Building Regulatory 
by the regulatory authority. The building shall be evaluated at both the Level l and Level 2 performance levels, and the more restrictive requirements shall apply. 
Basic Safety Earthquake 2 (BSE-2) in ASCE 41 shall be same as Risk-Targeted Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCER) in ASCE 7. Probabilistic response spectra defining other Earth­quake Hazard Levels shall be developed using site-specific ground motions in accordance with ASCE 7 Section 21.2 utiliz­ing the Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) relations used for the 2008 USGS seismic hazards maps for Western United States (WUS). When supported by data and analysis, other NGA rela­tions, that were not used for the 2008 USGS maps, shall be per­mitted as additions or substitutions. No fewer than three NGA relations shall be utilized. Response spectra shall incorporate the risk coefficient CR per ASCE 7 Section 21.2.1.1 



Ground-motion response history analysis shall be as set forth in ASCE 7 Chapter 16, Section 17.3 or Section 18.2.3. 

Exception: If the floor area of an addition is greater than the larger of 50 per cent of the floor area of the original building or 1,000 square feet (93m2), then the Table 3417.5 entries for BSE-R and BSE-C are replaced by BSE-1 and BSE-2, respectively. 
3417.6 Retrofit required. Where the evaluation indicates the building does not meet the required performance objectives of this section, the owner shall take appropriate steps to ensure that the building 's structural system is retrofitted in accordance with the provisions of Section 3417. Appropriate steps are either: 1) undertake the seismic retrofit as part of the additions, modifica­tions and/or repairs of the structure; or 2) provide a plan, acceptable to the building official, to complete the seismic retro­fit in a timely manner. The relocation or moving of an existing building is considered to be an alteration requiring filing of the 
plans and specifications approved by the building official. 
3417.7 The additions, modification or repair to any existing building are permitted to be prepared in accordance with the requirements for a new building, Chapter 16, Part 2, Title 24, 
C. C.R., 2013 edition, applied to the entire building.

3417.8 The requirements of ASCE 41 Chapter 9 are to apply to 
the use of seismic isolation or passive energy systems for the 
repair, modification or retrofit of an existing structure. When 
seismic isolation or passive energy dissipation is used, the pro­ject must have project peer review as prescribed in Section 3422.

D. At a minimum the project site will be visited by the responsi­ble design professional to observe existing conditions and to review the construction work for general compliance with approved plans, specifications and applicable structural regu­lations. Such visits shall occur at significant construction stages and at the completion of the structural retrofit. Struc­tural observation shall be provided for all structures. The plan 
for testing and inspection shall be submitted to the building official for review and approval with the application for permit. 
Additional requirements: For public schools and commu­nity colleges, construction material testing, inspection and observation during construction shall also comply with Section 4-333, Part 1, Title 24. 
3419.10.1 The registered design professional, or their designee, responsible for the structural design shall be retained to perform structural observation and independ­ently report to the owner of observations and findings as they relate to adherence to the permitted plans and good workmanship. 
3419.10.2 At the conclusion of construction, the structural observer shall submit to the enforcement agency and the owner a final written statement that the required site visits have been made, that the work, to the best of the structural observers knowledge and belief, is or is not in general con­


formity to the approved plans and that the observed struc­tural deficiencies have been resolved and/or listing those that, to the best of the structural observers knowledge and belief, have not been satisfactorily corrected. 
3419.10.2.1 The requirement for structural observation shall be noted and prominently displayed on the front sheet of the approved plans and incorporated into the general notes on the approved plans. 
3419.10.2.2 Preconstruction meeting. A preconstruc­tion meeting is mandatory for all projects which require structural observation. The meeting shall include, but is not limited to, the registered design professional, struc­tural observer, general constructor, affected subcontrac­tors, the project inspector and a representative of the enforcement agency (designated alternates may attend if approved by the structural observer). The structural observer shall schedule and coordinate this meeting. The purpose of the meeting is to identify and clarify all essen­tial structural components and connections that affect the lateral and vertical load systems and to review sched­uling of the required observations for the project's struc­tural system retrofit. 

3419.11 Temporary actions. When compatible with the build­ing use, and the time phasing for both use and the retrofit pro­gram, temporary shoring or other structural support is permitted to be considered. Temporary bracing, shoring and prevention of falling hazards are permitted to be used to qualify for Exception 1 in Section 3419.12 that allows inadequate 


capability in some existing components, as long as the required performance levels given in Section 3417 can be provided by the permanent structure. The consideration for such temporary actions shall be noted in the design documents. 


3419.12 Voluntary modifications to the lateral-force resisting system. Where modifications of existing structural components and additions of ne structural components are initiated for 
 the purpose of improving the lateraljorce resisting strength or stiffness of an existing structure and they are not required by other sections of this code, then they are permitted to be designed to meet an approved seismic performance criteria provided that an engineering analysis is submitted that follows:

be designed for seismic forces coming from any horizontal direction. 
Exception: The ASCE 41 Simplified Rehabilitation Method of Chapter 10 may be used if the Level 1 seismic perfor­mance level is S-3 or lower, the building's structural system is one of the primary building types described inASCE 41, Table 10-2, andASCE 41, Table 10-1 permits it use for the building height. 


SECTION 3421 METHOD S 


3421.1 The existing or retrofitted structure shall be demon­strated to have the capability to sustain the deformation response due to the specified earthquake ground motions and meet the seismic performance requirements of Section 3417. The registered design professional shall provide an evaluation of the response of the existing structure in its modified configu­ration and condition to the ground motions specified. If the building's seismic performance is evaluated as satisfactory and the peer reviewer( s,) and the enforcement agency concurs, then no further structural modifications of the lat­eral-load-resisting system are required. 

When the evaluation indicates the building does not meet the required performance levels given in Table 3417.5 for the risk category, then a retrofit and/or repair design shall be prepared that provides a structure that meets these performance objec­tives and reflects the appropriate consideration of existing con­ditions. Any approach to analysis and design is permitted to be used, provided that the approach shall be rational, shall be consistent with the established principals of mechanics and shall use the known performance characteristics of materials and assemblages under reversing loads typical of severe earth­quake ground motions. 
Exception: Further consideration of the structure's seismic performance may be waived by the enforcement agency if both the registered design professional and peer reviewer( s) conclude that the structural system can be expected to per­form at least as well as required by the provisions of this sec­tion without completing an analysis of the structure's compliance with these requirements. A detailed report shall be submitted to the responsible building official that pres­ents the reasons and basis for this conclusion. This report shall be prepared by the registered design professional. The peer reviewer( s) shall concur in this conclusion and affirm to it in writing. The building official shall either approve this decision or require completion of the indicated work speci­fied in this section prior to approval.

2. The enforcement agency may modify or waive the requirementsfor peer review when appropriate. 
3421.2.1 The approach used in the development of the design shall be acceptable to the peer reviewer and the enforcement agency and shall be the same method as used in the evaluation of the building. Approaches that are specifi­cally tailored to the type of building, construction materials and specific building characteristics may be used, if they are acceptable to the independent peer reviewer. The use of Method A allowed procedures may also be used under Method B. 
3421.2.2 Any method of analysis may be used, subject to acceptance by the peer reviewer( s) and the building official. The general requirements given in ASCE 41, Chapter 2, shall be complied with unless exceptions are accepted by the peer reviewer(s) and building official. Use of other than ASCE 41 procedures in Method B requires building official concurrence before implementation. 
3421.2.3 Prior to implementation, the procedures, methods, material assumptions and acceptance/rejection criteria proposed by the registered design professional will be peer reviewed as provided in Section 3422. Where nonlinear pro­cedures are used, prior to any analysis, the representation of the seismic ground motion shall be reviewed and approved by the peer reviewer( s) and the building official.

GlOl.l Purpose. The purpose of this appendix is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific 
flood hazard areas through the establishment of comprehen­sive regulations for management of flood hazard areas designed to: 
1. 	
Prevent unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 

2. 	
Manage the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels and shorelines; 

3. 	
Manage filling, grading, dredging and other develop­ment which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 



0 
4. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will divert floodwaters or which can increase flood hazards; and 
5. Contribute to improved construction techniques in the 
flood plain. G101.2 Objectives. The objectives of this appendix are to protect human life, minimize the expenditure of public money for flood control projects, minimize the need for res­cue and relief efforts associated With flooding, minimize pro­longed business interruption, minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, help maintain a stable tax base by pro­viding for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas, contribute to improved construction techniques in the flood plain and ensure that potential owners and occupants are notified that property is within flood hazard areas. 


G101.3 Scope. The provisions of this appendix shall apply to all proposed development in a flood hazard area established in Section 1612 of this code, including certain building work exempt from permit under Section 105.2. 
G101.4 Violations. Any violation of a provision of this appendix, or failure to comply with a permit or variance issued pursuant to this appendix or any requirement of this appendix, shall be handled in accordance with Section 114. 


SECTION G1 02 
APPLICABILITY 


G102.1 General. This appendix, in conjunction with the Cal­ifornia Building Code, provides minimum requirements for development located in flood hazard areas, including the sub­division of land; installation of utilities; placement and replacement of manufactured homes; new construction and repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or additions to new con­struction; substantial improvement of existing buildings and structures, including restoration after damage, temporary structures, and temporary or permanent storage, utility and miscellaneous Group U buildings and structures, and certain building work exempt from permit under Section 105.2. 





G102.2 Establishment of flood hazard areas. Flood hazard areas are established in Section 1612.3 of the California Building Code, adopted by the applicable governing authority on [INSERT DATE]. 
SECTION G1 03 
POWERS AND DUTIES 


Gl03.1 Permit applications. The building official shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed development sites Will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed development site is in a flood hazard area, all site development activities (including grading, filling, utility installation and drainage modification), all new construction and substantial improvements (including the placement of prefabricated buildings and manufactured homes) and certain building work exempt from permit under Section 105.2 shall be designed and constructed With methods, practices and materials that minimize flood damage and that are in accor­dance with this code and ASCE 24. 
G103.2 Other permits. It shall be the responsibility of the building official to assure that approval of a proposed devel­opment shall not be given until proof that necessary permits have been granted by federal or state agencies having juris­diction over such development. 
G103.3 Determination of design flood elevations. If design flood elevations are not specified, the building official is authorized to require the applicant to: 
1. 	
Obtain, review and reasonably utilize data available from a federal, state or other source, or 

2. 	
Determine the design flood elevation in accordance With accepted hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Such analyses shall be performed and sealed by a registered design professional. Studies, analyses and computations shall be submitted in suffi­cient detail to allow review and approval by the build­ing official. The accuracy of data submitted for such determination shall be the responsibility of the appli­cant. 


G103.4 Activities in riverine flood hazard areas. In river­ine flood hazard areas where design flood elevations are specified but floodways have not been designated, the build­ing official shall not permit any new construction, substantial improvement or other development, including fill, unless the 


2013 CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE 




applicant demonstrates that the cumulative effect of the pro­posed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated flood hazard area 
encroachment, will not increase the design flood elevation more than 1 foot (305 rnm) at any point within the community. 
G103.5 Floodway encroachment. Prior to issuing a permit for any floodway encroachment, including fill, new construc­tion, substantial improvements and other development or land-disturbing activity, the building official shall require submission of a certification, along with supporting technical data, that demonstrates that such development will not cause any increase of the level of the base flood. 
G103.5.1 Floodway revisions. A floodway encroachment that increases the level of the base flood is authorized if the applicant has applied for a conditional Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) revision and has received the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 

G103.6 Watercourse alteration. Prior to issuing a permit for any alteration or relocation of any watercourse, the building official shall require the applicant to provide notification of the proposal to the appropriate authorities of all affected adja­cent government jurisdictions, as well as appropriate state agencies. A copy of the notification shall be maintained in the permit records and submitted to FEMA. 
G103.6.1 Engineering analysis. The building official shall require submission of an engineering analysis which demonstrates that the flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse will not be decreased. Such watercourses shall be maintained in a manner which preserves the channel's flood-carrying capacity. 

G103.7 Alterations in coastal areas. Prior to issuing a per­mit for any alteration of sand dunes and mangrove stands in flood hazard areas subject to high velocity wave action, the building official shall require submission of an engineering analysis which demonstrates that the proposed alteration will not increase the potential for flood damage. 
G103.8 Records. The building official shall maintain a per­manent record of all permits issued in flood hazard areas, including copies of inspection reports and certifications required in Section 1612. 
SECTION G1 04 

PERMITS G104.1 Required. Any person, owner or authorized agent who intends to conduct any development in a flood hazard area shall first make application to the building official and shall obtain the required permit.

]106.2.1 GeneraL The requirements of this section shall 
/\

apply to temporary and permanent earth retaining shoring 
using soldier piles and lagging with or without tie-back 
anchors in soil or rock, only when existing or new DSA­SS, DSA-SS/CC or OSHPD 1 or 4 facilities are affected. 
Shoring used as construction means and methods only, 
which does not affect existing or new DSA-SS, DSA-SS/CC 
or OSHPD 1 or 4 facilities, are not regulated by DSA or 
OSHPD and shall satisfy the requirements of the authori­ties having jurisdiction. 



Design, construction, testing and inspection shall sat­
isfy the requirements of this code except as modified in 
Sections J106.2.2 through JJ06.2.8. 

]106.2.2 Duration. Shoring shall be considered tempo­
rary when elements of the shoring will be exposed to site 
conditions for a period of less than one ( 1) year, and shall 
be considered permanent otherwise. Permanent shoring 
shall account for the increase in lateral soil pressure due 

to earthquake. At the end of the construction period, the 
existing and new structures shall not rely on the tempo­
rary shoring for support in any way. Wood components 
shall not be used for permanent shoring lasting more than 
two (2) years. Wood components of the temporary shoring 
that may affect the performance of perman ent structure 
shall be removed after the shoring is no longer required.

protection or preservative treatment for their expected 
duration. Wood components of the temporary shoring that 
will not be removed shall be treated in accordance with 
A WPA Ul (Commodity Specification A, Use Category 4B 
and Section 5.2), and shall be identified in accordance 
with Section 2303.1.8.1. 

]106.2.3 Surcharge. Surcharge pressure due to footings, 
traffic or other sources shall be considered in design. If 
the footing surcharge is located within the semicircular 
distribution or bulb of earth pressure (when shoring is 
located close to a footings), lagging shall be designed for 
lateral earth pressure due to footing surcharge. Soil arch­
ing effects may be considered in the design of lagging. 
Underpinning of the footing may be used in lieu of design­
ing the shoring and lagging for surcharge pressure. Alter­
natively, continuously contacting drilled pier shafts near 
the footings shall be permitted. The lateral surcharge 
design pressure shall be derived using Boussinesq equa­
tions modified for the distribution of stresses in an elastic 
medium due to a uniform, concentrated or line surface 
load as appropriate and soil arching effects. 

]106.2.4 Design and testing: Except for the modifications 
as set forth in Sections J106.2.4.1 and J106.2.4.2 below, 
all Prestressed Rock and Soil Tie-back Anchors shall be
